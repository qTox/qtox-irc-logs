[17:43:58] <zetok> ha.

[17:59:22] * zetok wonders what has github changed to make things fail
[18:05:33] <iphy> zetok: they change stuff all the time
[18:05:45] <zetok> :|
[18:05:53] <zetok> I see
[18:05:55] <iphy> that's why the git-critique webhook constantly checks whether something changed
[18:06:04] <iphy> resulting in various small "fix this, fix that" PRs on github-tools
[18:06:06] * zetok goes to see if updated version of hubcaps has been published

[21:57:45] <zetok> Diadlo: any related
[21:58:16] <Diadlo> This script added in `CMakeList.txt` it's not required to run manually
[21:58:26] <zetok> ok
[21:58:36] <zetok> then there should be a comment in the script about that
[21:58:38] <Diadlo> I'm forget to remove it from CMakeList.txt in CMake_PR
[21:58:43] <Diadlo> Ok
[21:58:56] <zetok> (I haven't actually looked whether there is a comment for that in the script)
