[15:26:10] <zetok> bennabiy: no talk so far
[15:26:37] <bennabiy> Is it something that would be considered (thank you for answering by the way)
[15:26:59] <zetok> not really
[15:27:10] <bennabiy> or not even pam support, but perhaps jprintd
[15:27:16] <bennabiy> fprintd I mean
[15:27:33] <zetok> things that are hard to use and os-specific aren't a focus
[15:28:02] <bennabiy> I understan
[15:28:03] <bennabiy> d
[15:28:10] <zetok> they could be added to qTox if there's a lot of interest of them, but they would have to be made as an optional feature
[15:28:11] *** Quits: sudden6 (~anonymous@ ) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[15:29:14] <zetok> in other words, if someone will make a PR with the code that would just work and it was an optional thing, it would be merged
[15:29:36] <zetok> if no PR will be made, I wouldn't expect pam support
[15:30:18] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3332 ‚Üê an example, didn't get merged since it didn't work
[15:32:03] <zetok> (someone could take the code and make it work)
