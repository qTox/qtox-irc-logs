[14:28:01] <tux3> I didn't manage to fix it entirely yet
[14:28:03] <tux3> nurupo, ^
[14:28:17] <tux3> Everything's broken
[14:43:36] <zetok> what probably would fix it is compiling toxcore with autotools instead of cmake
[14:43:59] <tux3> Why would that change things?
[14:44:21] <zetok> autotools don't split things
[14:44:37] <zetok> i.e. old .a are in place
[14:45:28] <iphy> tux3: cmake builds several smaller libraries and if you use pkg-config, everything will just continue to work
[14:45:49] *** Joins: MDrights (~MDrights@ )
[14:45:49] <iphy> tux3: the pkg-config file links to all the small libraries
[14:45:56] <tux3> Oh
[14:46:03] <iphy> if you just link to libtoxcore.a, it won't work
[14:46:17] <tux3> I just pass -ltoxcore -ltoxav iirc
[14:46:29] <tux3> What's the magic pkg-config invocation?
[14:46:31] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] Unterstrichmoepunterstrich opened pull request #4036: german translation fix (master...master) https://git.io/vMqFR
[14:46:53] <zetok> :f
[14:47:11] * zetok should have pulled translations yesterday :/
[14:47:25] <zetok> iphy: where are docs for that?
[14:48:04] <iphy> tux3: pkg-config --libs libtoxcore
[14:48:09] <iphy> just like it was before
[14:48:29] <iphy> zetok: they don't exist
[14:48:43] <tux3> Alrighty, let's see what this does
[14:49:04] <zetok> iphy: that links toxcore statically?
[14:49:50] *** Joins: x_ (~x@ )
[14:49:50] <iphy> zetok: it passes -ltoxcore -ltoxencryptsave -ltoxdns -ltoxcrypto -l... all the things except toxav
[14:50:06] <iphy> like the autotools one
[14:50:27] <zetok> so it doesn't link statically.
[14:52:01] <zetok> _moep_: is #4036 yours?
[14:52:08] <_moep_> ack
[14:53:17] <iphy> 14:46 <@tux3> I just pass -ltoxcore -ltoxav iirc
[14:53:33] <tux3> Well, or the .a rather
[14:53:35] <iphy> it does that, but with the correct libraries
[14:53:37] <iphy> aha
[14:53:44] <iphy> well then it won't do the same thing
[14:53:59] <iphy> if you pass the .a manually, pkg-config doesn't help
[14:54:02] <tux3> I'm not actually sure, is the thing!
[14:54:17] <zetok> _moep_: 1. it's going to fail on travis due to commit name; 2. there's a bit of a problem, i.e. it most likely will conflict with translations from weblate
[14:54:24] <zetok> iphy: so it should be fixed
[14:54:30] <iphy> if you want to link some libraries statically and some others dynamically, it'll be a bit of a mess
[14:54:32] <iphy> zetok: how?
[14:54:33] <tux3> iphy, There's one mode where we do -Wl,-BStatic and then just -ltoxcore -ltoxav etc
[14:54:45] <zetok> iphy: do it with cmake like it was done with autotools
[14:54:46] <tux3> And one mode where we link the .a directly, depending on env
[14:55:04] <iphy> zetok: by having a single library?
[14:55:12] <zetok> iphy: yep
[14:55:18] <iphy> then no, it won't be fixed
[14:55:28] <zetok> why are you making toxcore harder to use?
[14:55:45] <iphy> to make it easier to maintain
[14:56:32] <zetok> how exactly making current docs irrelevant while not adding docs for the current stuff is making toxcore easier to maintain?
[14:56:54] <iphy> current docs are completely relevant
[14:57:01] <iphy> you're free to keep using the autotools build
[14:57:13] <iphy> it's part of the travis builds, so it'll keep working as it did
[14:57:14] <zetok> ok, so the cmake shouldn't be used for builds that one wants to use
[14:57:22] <zetok> good to know that
[14:57:27] <iphy> right
[14:57:38] <iphy> it's mostly useful for development
[14:57:40] <tux3> iphy, so concretely what do I link with for my static build?
[14:57:45] <zetok> I'll make a PR with fix to the docs, as they right now suggest that cmake is the way to go
[14:57:57] <iphy> zetok: thanks
[14:58:24] <tux3> pkg-config just fails with "Package libtoxcore was not found in the pkg-config search path."
[14:58:40] <tux3> Of course. toxcore isn't installed
[14:58:45] <zetok> nurupo: when toxcore can be switched to autotools back?
[14:58:52] <_moep_> zetok: 1. how can I change the commit name? 2. what kind of problems? I didn't translated 1:1
[14:59:23] <iphy> tux3: build with autotools or, if the environment doesn't permit that, link with all the libraries (toxcrypto toxnetwork toxdht toxnetcrypto toxfriends toxmessenger toxgroup)
[14:59:59] <tux3> iphy, would it be stupid to link with tox*.a ?
[15:00:16] <iphy> that might work, but they probably need to be in a certain order
[15:00:21] <tux3> Right
[15:00:38] <iphy> you could link with -( -) or something
[15:00:44] <iphy> I forgot what the option was
[15:00:56] <iphy> the "keep cycling through these libraries until you find all the symbols" option
[15:01:20] <iphy> yeah, -( -) it was
[15:01:28] <zetok> _moep_: 1. `git commit --amend && git push -f` ← assuming that you're currently on the branch used for PR; 2. there has been some work done on weblate, which when trying to merge stuff most likely would conflict: https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/tox/qtox/#history
[15:03:09] <tux3> iphy, is there some doc for what lib depends on what?
[15:03:42] <_moep_> zetok: whats PR?
[15:03:48] <zetok> _moep_: pull request
[15:03:48] *** Joins: sudden6 (~anonymous@ )
[15:03:55] <_moep_> ah
[15:04:13] <iphy> tux3: they depend on each other in this order: core -> group -> messenger -> friends -> netcrypto -> dht -> network -> crypto
[15:04:26] <tux3> Thanks
[15:05:42] <_moep_> zetok: so whats the best way to share my stuff in combination with weblate?
[15:05:52] <zetok> :|
[15:08:18] <zetok> _moep_: don't worry about that
[15:08:35] *** Quits: Sephi (~me@ ) (Quit: Si tacuisses, philosophus mansisses!)
[15:08:53] <zetok> _moep_: just in the future if you can it probably would be the best to just use weblate
[15:09:43] * zetok wonders whether translating instructions should point only to weblate
[15:09:54] <_moep_> ok
[15:12:25] <sudd3n6> zetok: will probably easier
[15:12:46] <sudd3n6> people knowing how to git will find the GH way anyway
[15:12:54] <zetok> mm
[15:13:21] <zetok> sudd3n6: do you have time for translation review & rebase of conflicting translation commit?
[15:14:16] <zetok> unless the changes are redundant (not likely?)
[15:19:00] <sudd3n6> not now, but tomorrow
[15:20:57] <zetok> ok
[15:22:25] <zetok> https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/pull/376 there we go
[15:28:07] <zetok> _moep_: https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format ← commit should be e.g. `feat(l10n): update .. translation`
[15:33:14] <zetok> tux3: um, have you tested whether Rust signing works for you?
[15:34:01] <tux3> zetok, I have not, but it LGTM so I expect to switch Soon™
[15:34:08] <tux3> My current priority is fixing the build
[15:34:13] <zetok> right

[16:06:35] <sudd3n6> anoa: what do you mean exactly?
[16:07:31] <sudd3n6> if a define is needed outside it's class it should be in the *.h file, else in the *.cpp file
[16:08:18] <anoa> 76 (the number of chars in a tox id) is used in chatmessage.cpp. I felt that should probably be defined globally.
[16:09:20] <sudd3n6> anoa: I created a class toxid
[16:09:32] <sudd3n6> it should go there
[16:09:57] <sudd3n6> there's also a regex to parse toxids in it
[16:10:07] <anoa> sudd3n6, ah perfect, thanks.
[16:11:06] <nurupo> tux3: did you link against all of the .a libraries?
[16:11:35] <tux3> nurupo, yeah, I just fixed it )
[16:11:50] <nurupo> tux3: there are libraries for each level of toxcore, e.g. libnetcrypto.a, libmessenger.a, libnetwork.a, etc
[16:12:10] <tux3> nurupo, iphy gave me the list earlier and I linked to that explicitely
[16:12:19] <nurupo> in theory all you need to do is just to link to them
[16:12:33] <nurupo> good, i tried to do that with no success
[16:14:36] <nurupo> tux3: the nihtly builds are still red though
[16:14:40] <nurupo> *nightly
[16:14:55] <tux3> zetok, I take it back, the rust sign tool doesn't work!
[16:15:07] <tux3> nurupo, yeah I need to fix those too when I have the time
[16:15:17] <zetok> tux3: oh?
[16:15:21] <tux3> Or rather I should make a qtox.pro patch and commit that

[16:17:19] <tux3> https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8957958
[16:18:23] <zetok> huh
[16:18:48] <zetok> tux3: you have a file named "Test" there, right?
[16:19:07] <tux3> zetok, nope! It should take the argument as data, not open a file
[16:19:20] <zetok> uh
[16:19:34] <zetok> ok
[16:19:39] <tux3> The update server invokes it like that: ./qtox-updater-sign `date +%s`!`cat gitversion` >> win32/version
[16:20:17] <sudd3n6> tux3: how in hell is that secure?
[16:20:25] <tux3> sudd3n6, what do you mean?
[16:20:43] <zetok> sudd3n6: it's not supposed to be
[16:20:47] <sudd3n6> afaict this doesn't involve signing the binary
[16:21:30] <tux3> No, the binary is signed separately
[16:21:40] <tux3> That's just the version file
[16:21:48] <sudd3n6> ok
[16:24:09] <tux3> I sent out 1.7.0

[16:39:16] <Emcy_> didnt seem to actually download anything either
[16:40:06] <tux3> So you were already on v1.7.0 then :) ?
[16:40:06] <Emcy_> i mean i just got it from tox.chat/downloads 10 mins ago and it did that when i ran it
[16:41:08] <anoa> Using something that was introduced in Qt >= 5.0 is fine, correct?
[16:41:10] <tux3> Ah. There was a new build a couple minutes later, it's the same but I was fixing some Jenkins config
[16:41:35] <tux3> anoa, up to 5.3.0 is fine
[16:41:51] <tux3> According to INSTALL.md
[16:41:52] <Emcy_> ok then

[19:45:22] <Emcy_> sanitising this is going to be anightmare

[19:49:26] <Emcy_> thats from a fresh log
[19:55:27] <Emcy_> i guess its possible its always done that and i didnt notice because i never went to the about page immediately after starting qtox before
[19:55:44] <Emcy_> but i thought it asks first and then only downloads stuff
[20:06:52] <tux3> It does ask first, except if it finds it's part-way through downloading, then that means it already asked and you said yes, but didn't finish
[20:07:17] <tux3> Do you have multiple qtox.exe or qtox-updater.exe running in the task manager?
[20:07:40] <Emcy_> no
[20:07:47] <tux3> It's failing to download the update because the file is already open for some reason
[20:07:56] <Emcy_> hm
[20:08:03] <Emcy_> where are updates downloaded to
[20:08:18] <tux3> C:/Users/<you>/AppData/Roaming/tox//update/./qtox.exe
[20:08:35] <Emcy_> ill delete that folder and see what happens
[20:08:50] <tux3> It looks as if that file is open (running). Or maybe it's your antivirus scanning it and taking a long time?
[20:10:00] <Emcy_> ok now its asking permission about an update from 20:04
[20:10:52] <Emcy_> looks like the update file was locked somehow but windows didnt complain about any locks when i deleted it
[20:11:09] <tux3> Strange.
[20:11:22] <tux3> Maybe the antivirus if you have one
[20:11:55] <Emcy_> [20:11:32.985 UTC] net/autoupdate.cpp:514 : Critical: downloadUpdate: Can't save new update file, aborting...
[20:12:11] <Emcy_> well its doing it again. But it definitely did complete download last time
[20:12:20] <Emcy_> it said restart qtox to update

[21:05:58] <x_> right, i see the INSTALL.md docs have been updated with ffmpeg info. will now edit the Troubleshooting builds wiki page to point people towards the ffmpeg build steps
[21:08:58] <zetok> thanks :)
[21:09:46] <x_> np, also won't people compiling ffmpeg need to install the ffmpeg dependencies?
[21:09:56] <x_> i think we'll have to point that out 
[21:26:02] <zetok> I'm not sure if I remember correctly, but the dependencies that are listed for toxcore are probably enough to compile ffmpeg
[21:30:37] <x_> i'll check

[21:32:46] <x_> newp, it misses a few
[21:32:49] <x_> i'll just include a link to the ffmpeg compilation guide (https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu)
[21:33:09] <x_> with a WARNING sign next to it :D
[21:34:22] <x_> that should make people extra careful
