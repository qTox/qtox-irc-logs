[11:10:19] <sudden6> zetok: I got ccache with OSX to work
[11:10:23] <sudden6> ↑
[11:10:32] <sudden6> can you review?
[11:17:42] <Emcy> is there any known problem with qtox not saving preferences on windows 10
[11:27:29] <sudden6> Emcy: not that I know of?
[11:27:40] <sudden6> what exactly doesn't work?
[11:27:59] <Emcy> my bro is complaining it wont save his preferences
[11:28:17] <Emcy> hes never online becuase autostart is not default
[11:28:36] <Emcy> hm. when exactly does qtox write preferences to disk
[11:29:02] <sudden6> at least before shutdown
[11:30:03] <Emcy> shutdown meaning?
[11:30:12] <sudden6> if you close qTox
[11:30:22] <Emcy> hm
[11:30:25] <sudden6> or logout of the profile
[11:30:44] <Emcy> i wonder how fast windows likes killing processes when shutting down the os
[11:30:58] <sudden6> that could be a problem

[17:56:43] <zetok> hm
[17:57:18] <zetok> I've been trying to figure out how to remove unnecessary spacings in settings
[17:57:54] <zetok> no dice so far
[17:58:12] <zetok> >SettingsWidget::SettingsWidget
[17:58:20] <zetok> am I even looking in the right place?

[18:17:38] <sudden6> zetok: contentlayout.cpp is also worth a look
[18:18:19] <sudden6> But this is used nearly everywhere, so changes could be difficult
