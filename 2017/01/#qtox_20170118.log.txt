[02:00:12] <nurupo> it's totally incorrect
[02:00:39] <nurupo> lookd like sudden6 is not on irc, huh
[02:03:42] <nurupo> the point of having a factory method was because the constructor might fail and you don't want to have a partially constructed object
[02:04:18] <nurupo> i don't see how your factory methods prevent from having a partially constructed object
[02:04:34] <nurupo> hm
[02:04:37] <nurupo> >ptr->passKey == nullptr
[02:04:41] <nurupo> ok, i missed that
[02:05:44] <nurupo> that changes everything
[02:09:58] <nurupo> i'd do it a bit differently, i'd move all constructor's code into the factory: if anything fails - return nullptr, if nothing fails, pass all the things into the constructor
[02:10:37] <nurupo> what you did seems to do the right thing though
[02:11:54] <nurupo> i'd suggest using std::make_unique()
[02:14:11] <nurupo> you can also use std::optional instead of std::unique_ptr if you don't want heap allocation, optional is in c++17 though
[02:14:34] <nurupo> nothing stops you from adding your own optional :)
