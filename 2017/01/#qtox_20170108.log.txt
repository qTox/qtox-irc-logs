[00:31:12] <sudden6> iphy: what do you think of this structure for a c-toxcore abstraction https://github.com/qTox/planning/blob/master/Core-Classdiagram.png
[00:36:05] <iphy> sudden6: would be nice to remove the garbage entries
[00:36:53] <sudden6> iphy: which garbage entries for example?
[00:37:02] <iphy> constructor, copy constructor
[00:37:08] <iphy> they are in everything
[00:37:18] <iphy> except toxcore
[00:37:43] <sudden6> IIRC constructors are supposed to be in a class diagram
[00:38:03] <iphy> fine
[00:38:40] <sudden6> but I agree with you that it's not yet perfect

[00:43:27] <nurupo> cmake bools take on ON/OFF
[00:43:36] <sudden6> nurupo: because it's not bool
[00:43:53] <sudden6> it's NO, MIN, ALL
[00:44:22] <nurupo> e.g. `cmake .. -D OPTIONS_NAME=ON` or `cmake .. -D OPTIONS_NAME:BOOL=ON` if you want to be explicit
[00:45:33] <sudden6> iphy: yes, I mean toxSave, it should read the salt from the datastream
[00:46:04] <sudden6> If I read the api correctly this should be possible
[00:47:45] <nurupo> well, in cmake variablres are generally (always?) strings, the BOOL and other types are used primarly for cmake-gui, so that i would show a checkbox for that option
[00:48:34] <sudden6> yeah, but we'd need a dropdown with three choices
[00:49:31] <nurupo> i see, you need three values. a string it is then
[00:50:13] <nurupo> i'm curious, does anyone here actually use cmake-gui and find it useful?
[00:50:38] <sudden6> I tried it, but didn't find it very useful

[08:11:48] <Diadlo> zetok: What did antis81 mean? "I can only strongly advice to not setup qmake and cmake in parallel -> ditch qmake in favour of cmake."
[08:40:10] *** Quits: Yoshimo (~anything@ ) (Quit: Yoshimo)
[08:59:13] <zetok> Diadlo: that we shouldn't maintain both
[09:00:42] <Diadlo> Why?
[09:01:52] <zetok> because that would unnecessarily drain resources & qmake would prevent things from being done
[09:02:09] <Diadlo> Ok
[09:02:33] <zetok> antis81 probably misunderstood and thought that we're planning to keep both qmake and cmake support long-term
[09:02:54] <Diadlo> I think we can drop qmake when we will have well-documented cmake

[10:51:24] <Diadlo> I'm added comment
[11:12:41] <sudden6> Diadlo: so it's done? :D
[11:13:04] <Diadlo> cmake?
[11:13:08] <sudden6> yes
[11:13:25] <Diadlo> Seems, yes
[11:13:34] <sudden6> \o/
[11:14:27] <sudden6> Diadlo: I plan to start implementing https://github.com/qTox/planning/blob/master/ToxEncrypt-Classdiagram.png the next time, what do you think?
[11:15:47] <Diadlo> About plan
[11:16:19] <Diadlo> 1) I builded umbrello and it's opens the diagram
[11:16:30] <Diadlo> 2) Why ToxFriend has `call` and `files`?
[11:16:55] <Diadlo> Does ToxFriend user (i.e. code) need to know Friend calls and files?
[11:17:00] <Diadlo> I don't think so
[11:17:06] <sudden6> because technically they belong to it
[11:17:28] <Diadlo> Technically widget and chatform belong to it too
[11:17:36] <Diadlo> Right?
[11:18:07] <sudden6> ie ToxCore recieves the callback from toxcore, looks up friendId, looks up callId and calls a function that emits a signall or whatever
[11:18:15] <sudden6> Diadlo: nope
[11:18:37] <Diadlo> I think, call should be stored in coreav
[11:18:41] <sudden6> FriendWidget connects to the signals and slots of ToxFriend
[11:18:51] <Diadlo> coreav.getCall(friendId)
[11:19:15] <Diadlo> I'm not sure
[11:19:19] <Diadlo> Just IMO
[11:19:28] <sudden6> Diadlo: I had this design before, but this introduces a second list where ToxFriend has to be managed in another thread -> problems
[11:21:04] <Diadlo> Current design don't help to avoid of multi-tread Friend using
[11:22:38] <sudden6> yep, but the only thing where it's critical is with the friendlist in Toxcore, if I'm right
[11:23:11] <sudden6> ie when ToxCore removes a friend, but ToxCoreAv tries to look it up
[11:24:49] <sudden6> but feel free to draw up different solutions so we can discuss them
[11:24:58] <Diadlo> And it's will not find and return => no problem. Problem will be if we remove friend while it used in another thread
[11:26:04] <sudden6> mhm
[11:26:23] <sudden6> I don't have time right now to discuss it, but I'll think about it
[11:26:31] <oranges> activate it
[11:26:58] <Diadlo> We can use shared_ptr. But antis81 or initramfs said, that it's not a best solution
[11:27:36] *** Quits: dardevelin (~dardeveli@ ) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[11:28:42] <sudden6> I don't really know^^ I don't have that much experience designing multithreaded applications, I just went ahead and did :)
[11:31:43] <sudden6> btw, I hit a 10 year old bug in Umbrello apparantly https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110232 :DD
[11:32:29] <zetok> classic KDE app
[11:35:18] <Diadlo> zetok: It isn't depend of KDE. I.e. if qTox will be alive after 10 years, I think we will have 10-years old bugs too :)
[11:35:36] * zetok hopes not
[11:36:02] <sudden6> software is never complete ;)
[11:36:14] <zetok> btw, there's ~1 regression 1.6→1.7 that no one seems to be working on
[11:36:28] <sudden6> which one?
[11:36:30] <zetok> sec
[11:37:00] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/4016
[11:37:22] <zetok> it would be nice to have at least regression fixed between releases
[11:37:48] <zetok> right now all regressions 1.6→1.7 are assigned to 1.8 milestone
[11:39:04] <zetok> there's also https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/4010 , if there's no response in a ~week someone will need to look into fixing it
[11:40:04] <sudden6> zetok: now, that you remind me, I think I've seen a piece of code responsible for this, that right now does nothing
[11:40:17] <zetok> >.<
[11:40:19] <sudden6> must have been some refactoring gone wrong
[11:42:38] <Diadlo> I just hope, that someone new come into qtox and will start with `E-easy`
[11:42:48] <sudden6> yep
[11:42:54] <zetok> about that
[11:43:09] <zetok> you've mentioned before that some E-easy aren't actually easy
[11:43:17] <Diadlo> Yes
[11:43:20] <zetok> is that still the case?
[11:43:21] <sudden6> or that some of the older devs will become active again
[11:43:39] <zetok> sudden6: not very likely
[11:43:51] <sudden6> I know
[11:44:06] <Diadlo> IDK. You should start to fix, to know, is it really easy, or not
[11:44:17] <zetok> :|
[11:44:51] <Diadlo> > older devs   I don't think, that they start with easy issues :)
[11:45:11] <zetok> ok
[11:45:29] <Diadlo> So... I mere cmake?
[11:45:37] <Diadlo> *merge
[11:45:41] <sudden6> +1
[11:46:16] <sudden6> cmake doesn't build for osx or windows yet, or does it?
[11:46:20] <zetok> the E-easy label should be assigned if you roughly ~know what needs to be done in order to fix the issue, and it is indeed easy
[11:46:38] <zetok> if that's not the case, it most likely should not be assigned
[11:46:49] <sudden6> maybe with writing down what needs to be done
[11:47:18] <zetok> sudden6: yeah, cmake is not yet "supported"
[11:49:38] <Diadlo> AFAIR osx and windows should be works
[11:50:06] <sudden6> tested or guessed? :DD
[11:50:08] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/2425 ← does that sound easy?
[11:50:49] <sudden6> haha, no
[11:51:06] <sudden6> maybe we should limit the number of E-easy to ~10?
[11:51:38] <zetok> um
[11:51:44] <zetok> the number is not relevant
[11:52:32] <sudden6> I think it is, see yourself as a new contributor, now there are >50 issues recommended to work on, which one do you take?
[11:52:50] <sudden6> now rethink the scenario with only 10 recommended
[11:53:08] <sudden6> I could be wrong, but I think the later is more motivating
[11:53:13] <zetok> >50 means a lot of choice when it comes to area to work on
[11:53:24] <zetok> which is a nice thing
[11:53:59] <sudden6> I think it can also cause confusion or a feeling helpless
[11:54:24] <sudden6> especially if you're new into software, I think this can happen
[11:54:47] <zetok> um
[11:55:25] <zetok> we have <20 issues that are marked as easy
[11:55:48] <zetok> sudden6: https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3334 ← is this really easy?
[11:56:15] <Diadlo> sudden6: For example, one `E-easy`. Do you agree, that it's wrong?)
[11:56:35] <sudden6> yes
[11:56:53] <Diadlo> Why 10 better then 1?
[11:57:28] <Diadlo> I think we shouldn't have a limit of easy issues
[11:57:36] <zetok> sudden6: https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3750#issuecomment-266987320 ← ?
[11:58:09] <zetok> sudden6: I think that focusing on quality, rather than numbers is more important
[11:58:18] <sudden6> ok
[11:58:49] <zetok> i.e. if only the issues that are actually easy will be labelled with `E-easy`, their number naturally will be kept low
[11:59:43] <sudden6> yeah, I should have looked at the actual numbers before, I thought there were more
[12:00:14] <zetok> so, #3334 needs `E-easy` removed?
[12:00:34] <sudden6> +1
[12:01:18] <zetok> and I think that either someone should help the guy with the PR, or take over and finish it (or at least keep rebasing)
[12:01:42] <sudden6> does toxcore even have upnp support yet?
[12:01:50] <zetok> no
[12:02:00] <zetok> the PR is about UDP port only
[12:02:37] <zetok> and we're down to 16 E-easy
[12:03:22] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3159 ← not something that can be done ATM, removed label
[12:07:32] <Diadlo> I think https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3159 should be closed
[12:07:53] <Diadlo> It's a long discussion about default settings
[12:08:10] <zetok> well
[12:08:17] <zetok> it's waiting for more feedback
[12:08:25] <Diadlo> How many?
[12:08:42] <Diadlo> If I will write something do we close it? ^^
[12:09:15] <zetok> well, the default should be set to what most people prefer
[12:10:09] <zetok> right now it seems like ~ 50/50 split :/
[12:10:41] <Diadlo> sudden6: Do you want `close to tray` by default?
[12:15:38] <sudden6> Diadlo: no

[18:57:48] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] sudden6 opened pull request #4060: refactor(core): Introduce new class ToxEncrypt to interface with toxe… (master...refactor_toxencrypt) https://git.io/vMWGE
[18:57:54] <sudden6> Code is out, I'll take a break
[19:02:51] <zetok> err
[19:05:23] <nurupo> sudden6: why are there 3 of `tox_pass_key_free(passKey);`?
[19:05:32] <nurupo> having one in the destructor is enough
[19:06:58] <nurupo> oh, i see, you want to set it to null
[19:11:40] <nurupo> if you are trying to avoid using exceptions and your constructor may fail, i find it better to use a static method that constructs the object (i.e. a factory method) rather than have this isValid() you have or alternativly rather than have init()
[19:12:26] <nurupo> a static method which returns a unique_ptr on the object on successful construction or nullptr on the failure
[19:13:46] <nurupo> that way you can't end up with an inproperly initialized class insstance -- isValid() == false, or forget to initialize it -- forget to call the init()
[19:14:06] <nurupo> if you have the class instance, you know that it's properly initialized
[19:14:08] *** Quits: x_ (~x@ ) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[19:16:21] <nurupo> the downsides are that it's a bit cubersome to write the factory method and it would do heap allocation (unless make_unique does some black magic that i forgot about)

[21:07:48] <Emcy> guys how about making it slightly difficult to exit the qtox program by default
[21:08:07] <zetok> :D
[21:08:12] <Emcy> like enable 'close to tray' and autostart by default
[21:09:02] <Emcy> because i have some normy family members who are on my ass because qtox exists when they click the x button which is not how most messenging things behave today
[21:09:27] <Emcy> zetok what does ':D' mean
[21:09:33] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3159#issuecomment-271150645
[21:10:35] <Emcy> well this will continue to be a problem then
[21:10:49] <zetok> well, you can ask reddit & places for help
[21:11:18] <Emcy> what?
[21:12:04] <zetok> make a public poll on what IM program should do when clicked on `x` or something
[21:13:02] <Emcy> id say people should learn what the goddamn window buttons do. But thats not going to happen and its unrealistic to expect it to happen
[21:14:21] <zetok> ok
[21:14:49] <zetok> then there's no problem with making a poll that will support the claim that most people expect `x` button to just minimize the window, right?
[21:15:52] <Emcy> the decision has been made so why would i bother
[21:16:02] <zetok> um?
[21:16:32] <zetok> Emcy: the decision to close the issue was made
[21:16:49] <zetok> since clearly majority doesn't want defaults to be changed
[21:17:21] <zetok> Emcy: if you have data that proves otherwise, default obviously can be changed
[21:17:22] <Emcy> majority of people in that thread maybe
[21:17:32] <zetok> :)
[21:17:44] <zetok> I don't have any other proper data points
[21:17:57] <Emcy> so your development is a direct democracy?
[21:18:08] <zetok> more or less
[21:18:54] <Emcy> im not here trying to legislate changes. Its anecdote from the extreme normie end of the UX
[21:19:18] <Emcy> its mostly skypes fault. You have to really try to exit skype.
[21:19:44] <Emcy> that has driven expectations i think
[21:19:56] <zetok> most likely
[21:21:25] *** Quits: reBrain (~quassel@ ) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:21:26] <zetok> although I wonder about that
[21:21:36] <zetok> is skype really that hard to close?
[21:22:26] <Emcy> iirc by default you have to dig the try icon out of the tray and right click it and say exit and then confirm
[21:22:28] *** Joins: barmaley (~barmaley@ )
[21:23:25] <zetok> doesn't sound very hard
[21:23:57] <Emcy> its not 'hard' but you cant do it by accident
[21:25:02] <zetok> anyway
[21:25:26] <zetok> Emcy: could you get more people to support changing defaults?
[21:26:03] <Emcy> i dont have social media accounts
[21:26:44] <zetok> tor → make some?
[21:26:44] <Emcy> a compromise would be a simple confirmation dialogue when exiting the program with the x button
[21:26:48] <Emcy> surely that would be reasonable
[21:27:04] <Emcy> if people still fuck up after that, not much you can do
[21:31:42] <Emcy> zetok if i make a github account and open an issue with that suggestion, are you likely to just close it
[21:32:25] <zetok> not just
[21:32:37] <zetok> but chances are that it could get closed
[21:33:26] <Emcy> so is that yes or no
[21:33:51] <zetok> um, switching the default is easier than making qTox always display confirmation window every time `x` is pressed, both code-wise and convincing-people-wise
[21:34:13] <Emcy> ill take that as no

[23:00:23] <sudden6> nurupo: interesting idea, but I don't if it's the "right" thing for qTox... Diadlo?
[23:02:27] <Diadlo> I'm think a bit about it. I'm not sure, but idea looks good. This way guarantees, than every created instance is correct
[23:03:02] <Diadlo> But we have a problem with static method
[23:03:15] <sudden6> which problem?
[23:03:30] <Diadlo> If we use static method => we can't mock or face instance
[23:03:36] <Diadlo> *fake
[23:04:20] <Diadlo> For tests we don't want work with real tox profile
[23:04:43] <Diadlo> Just instance, which implement same interface
[23:05:01] <Diadlo> sudden6: Do you understand?
[23:05:34] <sudden6> ~somewhat, I've to search for some stuff while you're explaining it
[23:06:19] <sudden6> Diadlo: what speaks against using different methods for testing/running like in http://stackoverflow.com/a/6542335?
[23:07:05] <sudden6> also, for this particular class, it hasn't anything to do with the Pofile
[23:07:15] <sudden6> we could just test this class standalone
[23:07:44] <Diadlo> Yes, it's one of the way. But if we will go this way, we need to build different clients for different tests
[23:07:50] <Diadlo> At least 2 build
[23:08:53] <Diadlo> And we will have build-related tests
[23:09:36] <Diadlo> This is the way that toktok have chosen
[23:10:09] <Diadlo> *plan to choose

[23:22:36] <sudden6> nurupo: I think another idea would be to leave it like it is, because the encryption and decryption will just fail, which must be expected anyway
