[02:19:41] <apollo11w> Ah okay. So why should I use tox over jabber?
[02:20:14] <zetok> encryption
[02:20:29] <apollo11w> But jabber has onemo or otr
[02:20:39] <apollo11w> How does tox encrypt its traffic?
[02:21:29] <zetok> NaCl/libsodium
[02:22:50] <zetok> dunno about onemo, but otr implementation that (all/most?) jabber clients used had this wonderful security vulnerability that allowed remote code execution
[02:24:26] <apollo11w> I for one use gajim

[19:27:02] <sudden6> make sure to get a recent release or git if you want to open the diagrams in planning
[19:27:50] <antis> ah have a better idea -> actually qt creator has a builtin tool :)
[19:28:46] <zetok> >core/coreav.cpp:299 : Debug: CoreAV::cancelCall: Backed off of thread-switch lock
[19:28:54] * zetok wonders
[19:28:56] <Diadlo> antis: Where?
[19:29:23] <zetok> Diadlo: ok, it's reproducible when one switches clicking between audio and video call buttons
[19:29:47] <antis> wait: It's a plugin called ModelEditor - and it actually can do reverse engineering AFIAK it is somewhat beta, but it works stable… :)
[19:30:20] <zetok> also, an interesting thing – qTox uses 600% CPU
[19:30:45] <Diadlo> zetok: AFAIR it's old issue. Isn't it?
[19:31:08] <zetok> yeah
[19:31:12] <antis> https://wiki.qt.io/ModelEditor
[19:31:47] <antis> @zetok you have that many cores? then it's normal…
[19:32:00] <Diadlo> antis: I prefer to use separate tools :)
[19:32:01] <zetok> antis: https://a.uguu.se/RqZwer8b5rcI.png ← normal?
[19:32:10] <Diadlo> But I will try
[19:32:35] <antis> @diadlo same here - usually i use umlet but it's been looooooong time i drew my last uml…
[19:33:55] <zetok> Diadlo: well, the issue is reproducible on master with lots of calls :/
[19:33:57] <antis> anyway that's not the point… i rather like to show what's available and how it works in the hope to increase a better understanding…
[19:34:38] <zetok> load average is 12, nice way to DoS someone's box that doesn't have as much CPU power
[19:35:33] <sudden6> does anyone know if it's possible to run mac os in kvm?
[19:35:41] <zetok> sudden6: it is
[19:35:49] <zetok> sudden6: but AFAIK license doesn't allow for it
[19:36:00] <sudden6> :/
[19:37:20] <antis> zetok: yes, normal. if your htop shows it, it means qTox is using 6 cores at 100% => 600% (it is historically, because back then there were only single-cores).
[19:39:38] <zetok> oh, and what's better, qTox can't even close itself
[19:39:49] <zetok> >main.cpp:312 : Debug: Clean exit with status 0
[19:39:55] <zetok> and it's still running :D
[19:42:26] <antis> hm… topic??

[19:43:31] <sudden6> antis: this PR https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/4065
[19:43:41] <antis> not interested, sorry :)
[19:43:44] <sudden6> or a bug that it uncovers :)
[19:49:17] <sudden6> zetok: maybe you somehow managed to flood the event queue of qt^^
[19:53:55] <zetok> hmm, interesting
[19:54:15] <zetok> looks like system was also heavily loaded
[19:55:10] <zetok> usr sys
[19:55:10] <zetok>  61  39
[19:55:37] <sudden6> hehe, qtox benching the kernel ;)
[19:56:02] <zetok> at least it doesn't cause kernel panics like µTox :|
[19:57:21] <sudden6> I'd be pretty proud if qTox caused a kernel panic
[20:35:41] <sudden6> zetok: do you have a conclusion for #4065?
[20:35:59] <sudden6> is it responsible for the problems you mentioned or not?
[20:36:24] <sudden6> and can you add that to the PR?
[20:42:37] <zetok> the CPU usage thing is not related to the PR
