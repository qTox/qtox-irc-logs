[04:41:47] <Se7en> Who is the moderator in #tox
[04:42:01] <Emcy> no one
[04:42:06] <Se7en> I wish to ask for help, but I am still banned after posting a joke over a year ago...
[04:42:07] <Emcy> its like somaila in there
[04:42:53] <Se7en> I've switched to toxic
[04:43:01] <Se7en> And I am having problems with the repo
[04:43:12] <Se7en> Using the nightly
[04:43:16] <Se7en> pkg.tox.chat
[04:43:26] <Se7en> Newest update of ToxAv results in a segfault
[04:43:37] <Se7en> se7en@workstation:~$ tox
[04:43:39] <Se7en> toxic: error while loading shared libraries: libtoxav.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[04:43:41] <Se7en> se7en@workstation:~$ 
[04:44:28] <Se7en> Tox is actually a script I made which allows me to not need to enter the proxy informatiuon each time
[04:46:10] <robinli> Try running `sudo ldconfig`
[04:46:10] <Se7en> Does anyone have information to give me on this
[04:46:23] <Se7en> Nope, did not change anything
[04:46:37] <Se7en> I also thoufght that apt runs it itself

[05:07:19] <nurupo> Se7en: what distribution version?
[05:07:30] <Se7en> I am using Devuan Jessie
[05:07:50] <Se7en> Devuan is a beta fork of Debian which is focused on minimalism and removes Systemd completely
[05:14:59] <nurupo> Se7en: just installed toxic on my debian jessie system, don't have any issue running it
[05:15:07] <Se7en> I'm using the nightly repo
[05:15:12] <Se7en> Did you add the nightly repo?
[05:17:47] *** Joins: [0xAA] (~ThisIsZen@ )
[05:20:24] <nurupo> hm
[05:20:46] <nurupo> it looks like it was using previously installed toxcore, i removed that and can reproduce the issue
[05:22:18] *** Quits: x_ (~x@ ) (Remote host closed the connection)
[05:22:56] <nurupo> Se7en: i have unbanned you in #tox
[05:23:00] <Se7en> So the issue is in the latest Toxcor
