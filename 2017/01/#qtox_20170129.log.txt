[08:11:30] <vit9696> Are you sure it works? Last time I saw it it lacked fixing plugin paths and ffmpeg libraries, which makes it very likely to fail.

[14:08:18] <vit9696> всех ненавижу
[14:08:45] <vit9696> oops
[14:08:48] <vit9696> wrong chat
[14:09:07] <vit9696> yet this was caused by improperly written qTox build scripts :/
[14:10:25] <vit9696> Could anyone explain why qTox bootstrap script does not install libtoxav?
[14:10:34] <vit9696> this was the last error I got
[14:10:38] <vit9696> -- Checking for one of the modules 'libtoxav'
[14:10:39] <vit9696> CMake Error at cmake/Dependencies.cmake:72 (message):
[14:10:39] <vit9696>   TOXAV package, library or framework not found
[14:12:08] <sudden6> vit9696: what were the commands you used?
[14:12:25] <vit9696> followed the wiki basically
[14:12:33] <sudden6> and please upload the rest of the build output to gist.github.com
[14:12:54] <vit9696> ./osx/qTox-Mac-Deployer-ULTIMATE.sh -i
[14:12:55] <vit9696> ./osx/qTox-Mac-Deployer-ULTIMATE.sh -b
[14:13:57] <vit9696> it is going to be a bit problematic because I had to fix the script and did not store the output.
[14:14:28] <vit9696> the question is pretty straightforward, why ToxAV is not installed 
[14:14:45] <vit9696> it is not mentioned in any of the scripts but cmake from what I could see
[14:15:11] <vit9696> in CMakeLists it is marked as optional but the builder ignores it.
[14:16:01] <vit9696> https://ghostbin.com/paste/byvpz that is the cmake output, but I doubt you would see anything here
[14:16:50] <sudden6> did the installation of toxcore succeed?
[14:17:18] <sudden6> there should be some output that it was compiled with toxav
[14:18:02] <vit9696> it did
[14:18:10] <vit9696> let me rebuild from scratch I guess… 
[14:18:15] <vit9696> so that I could inspect the logs
[14:18:32] <vit9696> perhaps it did build itself without toxav for some reason
[14:19:07] <sudden6> yeah, if it still doesn't work, please create a new issue on github
[14:19:37] <sudden6> and upload the logs there
[14:20:00] <vit9696> xdddd
[14:20:02] <vit9696> on mac?
[14:20:16] <vit9696> you never fix the issues there, and I am actually trying to help you solve them… 
[14:20:17] <vit9696> sigh
[14:20:55] <vit9696> toxav is part of toxcore, right?
[14:20:59] <sudden6> yes
[14:21:17] <sudden6> nobody of the devs owns a mac, so we are basically doing blind coding^^

[14:23:21] <sudden6> actually the Travis CI config could provide you with valuable input what goes wrong

[14:23:44] <vit9696> oho, a second time it worked 
[14:24:25] <vit9696> I wonder if the first time it failed because of the delinquent qTox desire to build from ~/ 
[14:25:04] <sudden6> maybe

[19:25:03] <zetok> vit9696: could you make a PR?
[19:26:03] <zetok> >+MACFIXRPATH="${QTOX_DIR}/osx/macfixrpath" 
[19:26:24] <zetok> this should be done by cmake, if it doesn't do that, it's a bug
[19:30:25] <zetok> oh, there is PR already
[19:33:28] <vit9696> I am fixing the stuff now

[21:10:06] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] vit9696 opened pull request #4108: Deployment fixes for macOS (master...master) https://git.io/vDUjr
[21:10:18] <vit9696> ok… here we go
[21:10:52] <vit9696> I do not have much time to deal with qTox, but I hope this will be enough for you.
[21:11:13] <zetok> vit9696: https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format
[21:11:21] <vit9696> I think I fixed all the known deploy issues—
[21:11:31] <vit9696> ngh…. 
[21:12:24] <vit9696> Alright, you are welcome to close pull request and make it the way it conforms to the project needs.
[21:13:25] <vit9696> Sorry, but it will be quicker for you than for me to follow your contribution guides, and I am very short on time 
[21:17:00] <zetok> um
[21:17:35] <vit9696> hm… and it looks like travis-ci dislikes something
[21:17:44] <vit9696> fatal: No names found, cannot describe anything.
[21:22:58] <vit9696> it probably is related to some weird git issues, but I have no time to play with travis, works just fine locally.
[21:23:18] <vit9696> enabled maintainer changes, so that hopefully someone could figure this out
[21:23:38] <vit9696> gl & sorry for some extra work ;)
