[20:20:20] <zetok> tux3: v1.7.0 ?
[20:20:50] <tux3> zetok, hai!
[20:20:51] <tux3> Sure
[20:21:47] <tux3> zetok, do I just need to release the auto-updates, or also the windows stable versions?
[20:22:03] <zetok> both?
[20:22:10] <zetok> (is there a difference?)
[20:22:56] <tux3> Yep
[20:23:48] <tux3> The installers are built on Jenkins (any project member can trigger it), the auto-updates need Yours Truly's manual approval
[20:24:02] <zetok> hmm
[20:24:17] <zetok> 'bout the updates
[20:24:22] <zetok> tux3: https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/4028 :3
[20:24:53] <tux3> Hhmm
[20:25:21] <zetok> tux3: just to make sure – signature+bytes are supposed to be just written to stdout, right?
[20:25:28] *** Quits: sudden6 (~anonymous@ ) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[20:25:57] <zetok> tux3: which makes me wonder, why did you use detached signature fn, since the signing function returns signature+bytes anyway
[20:26:12] <tux3> Yep
[20:26:56] <zetok> also regarding changes to update process https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/4032
[20:28:20] *** Joins: sudden6 (~anonymous@ )
[20:29:29] <tux3> Did you compare that your rust version gives the same output?
[20:29:59] <zetok> kinda
[20:30:18] <zetok> stdout output looked about the same
[20:30:28] <sudden6> tux3: o/
[20:30:32] * zetok didn't compare actual bytes
[20:30:34] <tux3> sudden6, hi!
[20:30:47] <sudden6> welcome to 2017 with qTox ;)
[20:30:58] <tux3> zetok, I'd rather not break the updater because signature format changed slightly
[20:31:03] <tux3> sudden6, happy new year!
[20:31:48] <tux3> zetok, also, are we using toktok's toxcore now?
[20:31:52] <zetok> tux3: yep
[20:31:55] <tux3> Awesome
[20:32:45] <zetok> ok, I'll compile bsdiff and see whether there's any difference in output
[20:33:02] <zetok> actually, wait a sec
[20:33:04] <sudden6> will there be a windows release in the near future? :)
[20:33:10] <zetok> that probably can be done with bash
[20:33:15] <sudden6> zetok: can't you just md5sum it?
[20:33:21] <zetok> :f
[20:33:40] <zetok> that's not the same
[20:34:29] <tux3> Ok I fixed the stable builds, the new version should be ready in ~15 min
[20:34:35] <zetok> \o/
[20:34:38] <sudden6> \o/
[20:35:29] <tux3> zetok, about #4032 multiple sources: why ?
[20:36:03] <zetok> tux3: to not force users to manually install newer version if something happens with the domain
[20:36:36] <tux3> You mean if we lose control of the domain for example?
[20:36:41] <zetok> yep
[20:36:52] <sudden6> good idea
[20:36:56] <tux3> Meh :/
[20:37:23] <zetok> + it might help with a situation where "main" domain is blocked
[20:37:23] <tux3> If we lose control of the domain, then currently someone could do a replay attack to downgrade you to a previous version
[20:37:32] <sudden6> is there a version number inside the updater format?
[20:37:53] <tux3> Yes, but it's not used to determine wether to update
[20:37:53] <zetok> as an extension of the idea, I'd want to have updater also check if .onion domain would be accessible when qTox uses socks5 proxy
[20:38:08] <tux3> No no that's too dangerous
[20:38:17] <tux3> Controlling the domain allows attacks
[20:38:26] <zetok> err
[20:38:35] <zetok> that kinda sounds wrong
[20:38:42] <sudden6> tux3: including a monotonic build nr should help against that
[20:39:07] <tux3> sudden6, yeah, the update code could use some improvements :)
[20:39:21] <sudden6> mhm
[20:39:31] <tux3> Right now it allows downgrades so if you have an alpha/nightly build you can go back to stable
[20:39:45] <tux3> But that means if the domain is stolen, someone can push a forced downgrade
[20:39:53] <sudden6> that's bad
[20:40:05] <zetok> tux3: yep, Rust qtox-updater-sign produces same output as C++
[20:40:20] <tux3> zetok, awesome
[20:40:45] <sudden6> something like release channels would make sense, but complexity++
[20:42:21] <zetok> would the complexity really go up that much?
[20:43:00] <zetok> `qTox` `qTox Nightly` – 2 different programs, installed in 2 different locations
[20:43:21] <zetok> or any other suffix
[20:45:34] <sudden6> you mean switching a release = reinstall
[20:45:44] <sudden6> *switching channel
[20:46:56] <zetok> *install
[20:47:19] <zetok> there's no reason to not have multiple channels installed concurrently
[20:47:22] <tux3> Bad news, the stable builds failed and I don't kknow why :/
[20:47:49] <zetok> probably the changes in qtox.pro
[20:48:01] <zetok> or maybe not
[20:48:10] <sudden6> `__stack_chk_guard'
[20:48:15] <zetok> ah.
[20:48:27] <sudden6> stack protection breaking things apparently
[20:48:35] <zetok> :|
[20:49:02] <sudden6> but there's more
[20:49:31] <sudden6> seems like linking failed completely
[20:50:17] <zetok> probably because libs aren't hardened
[20:55:25] <sudden6> tux3: I think that could be the problem for windows https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/qtox.pro#L49
[20:55:57] <sudden6> now we just need to find out which of the flags breaks things
[20:56:14] <tux3> I'll remove the stack protector and see if that helps
[20:56:46] <tux3> Oh wait no I don't have SSH to the build machine anymore -_-
[20:57:11] <zetok> just patch the source
[20:57:34] <sudden6> tux3: is there an easy way to reproduce the build environment somewhere? ie source of the build scripts?
[20:58:00] <tux3> Not really, since there's a ton of Jenkins job you'd need to copy
[20:58:16] <tux3> You can do it manually, but I wouldn't call that easy
[20:58:41] <sudden6> Would it be feasible to put all the jenkins scripts into a GH repo so we at least have a point to start?
[20:59:10] <sudden6> because right now, the only ~working windows build is the jenkins one
[20:59:25] <tux3> I suppose, but there's a lot of other necessary configuration in Jenkins that isn't in the script
[20:59:29] <zetok> or you could just use docker
[20:59:30] <tux3> The scripts are just part of it
[20:59:54] * zetok has started automating process of doing that
[20:59:55] <tux3> We can sort-of export the Jenkins config as a big messy XML file, which sucks
[21:00:42] <sudden6> that's bad
[21:00:51] <tux3> Docker is an idea
[21:01:17] <zetok> once I'm done, there should be a few scripts that together create a vm, configure docker in it, setup stuff for qTox & produce windows build
[21:01:47] <sudden6> nice, what's the current state of it?
[21:02:08] <zetok> just fixed installing kernel
[21:02:52] <zetok> so now I'm waiting for when vm with installed kernel will build; once I have that I'll start automating docker stuff
[21:03:54] <zetok> debian is really slow when it comes to installing stuff :/
[21:04:42] <tux3> Especially on a spinning rust disk
[21:04:55] <zetok> yeah.. but not only
[21:05:16] <zetok> i.e. the bottleneck isn't really IO bound AFAICT
[21:06:00] <tux3> It is for me :/
[21:06:03] <sudden6> maybe someone sprinkled random sleep(50) somewhere :D
[21:07:28] <tux3> Welp, I don't know how to fix this
[21:07:35] <zetok> error?
[21:08:33] <tux3> Still the linking error
[21:09:04] <zetok> link?
[21:09:08] <tux3> https://build.tox.chat/view/qtox/job/qTox-stable_build_windows_x86-64_release/112/console
[21:09:31] <tux3> There's two things: Linking error with toxcore, and with the stack check
[21:10:12] <tux3> Of course it works fine for me on Linux
[21:10:53] <sudden6> disable the stack check for now?
[21:12:05] <tux3> I'm not sure how to test that without making a new commit
[21:12:18] <tux3> Adding a patch to the build script I guess
[21:30:59] <zetok> g'night
[21:31:08] <sudden6> night
[21:34:39] <tux3> Night
[21:34:59] <tux3> Ok so removing the stack protector fixes the stack check problem, but it still fails to link with toxcore..
[21:36:09] <tux3> I'm going to give up for today, but here's the patch I used for reference: http://pastebin.com/x4y7ketq
[21:36:26] <sudden6> does uTox have the same problem? maybe the tox build is borked...

[22:04:00] <tux3> _moep_, the %1 and %2 mean some text will be inserted here, usually a number or the name of something
[22:04:50] <tux3> You have to add them in the same place in the translation so things will be inserted correctly

[23:48:39] <_moep_> somewhere below I was reading something like "it can be empthy or min 6 chars"
[23:50:40] <tux3> Yes, you can either not use a password, of if you use one it must have 6 characters minimum
[23:51:02] <tux3> This is the text that appears in a tool-tip when you hover over the password field
[23:51:41] <_moep_> <source>Password input field, minimum 6 characters long</source> <- so this is the howertext?
[23:52:10] <tux3> Techinically it's the "accessible description", it's used to describe what the password field does
[23:52:24] <tux3> Probably, it will appear as a tooltip (but that's not guaranteed)
[23:52:25] <Diadlo> _moep_: Is mostly for screen reader
[23:52:38] <_moep_> ah ok
[23:52:44] <tux3> Ah yes, screen readers
[23:53:19] <_moep_> and why are there so many source like "bla bla page"?
[23:55:40] <tux3> It's how we call the different screens, like the "profile page", the "add friend page"
[23:56:12] <_moep_> I translated it now 1:1 
[23:58:41] <_moep_> whats the difference between a circle and a group?
[23:59:54] <tux3> A group is a chat room with people talking together, a circle is a set of contacts in your contact list
