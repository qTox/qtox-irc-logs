[00:00:43] <_sudden6_> and the other thing is, how can we extend Friend, that it can for example hold an Alias?
[00:00:59] <_sudden6_> because that's not a thing in c-toxcore
[00:01:37] <Diadlo> Core store list<Friend> friendlist
[00:01:42] <Diadlo> *should store
[00:02:16] <Diadlo> And we can get an access through core->getFriendList()
[00:02:51] <Diadlo> About alias -- good question
[00:03:11] <_sudden6_> mhm, but can we make it so, that everything besides Core only has read access?
[00:03:21] <_sudden6_> or is that impossible with C++?
[00:03:45] <Diadlo> Return all by const
[00:04:01] <Diadlo> const list<const Friend&> getFriendList()
[00:04:19] <_sudden6_> ah :)
[00:04:20] <Diadlo> Forgot one &
[00:06:14] <_sudden6_> ok, I think the overal direction is clear, I'll refine this tomorrow and upload it to GH
[00:06:47] <Diadlo> Do you have an idea how resolve problem with extending?
[00:07:13] *** Joins: sudden6 (~anonymous@ )
[00:07:19] <_sudden6_> not really
[00:07:27] <Diadlo> We can create extra layer
[00:07:35] <_sudden6_> Create another class that holds a pointer to Friend?
[00:07:37] <Diadlo> ToxCore -> Core -> qTox
[00:07:52] <Diadlo> ToxCore have list<Friend>
[00:08:03] <Diadlo> Core have list<qFriend>
[00:08:19] <Diadlo> Where qFriend has an alias
[00:08:39] <Diadlo> But I'm not sure
[00:08:56] <Diadlo> I will think about it\
[00:09:00] <Diadlo> Good night
[00:09:01] <_sudden6_> I think it would be better to create qFriend with a pointer to Friend
[00:09:10] <_sudden6_> ok, night :)

[15:39:13] <sudden6> what do you think of the stuff i did?
[15:40:30] <zetok> >ToxId → publicKey → QString
[15:40:32] <zetok> hmm.

[15:46:19] <zetok> sudden6: regarding ToxPk, that's a step in the right direction; regarding diagram, I'm don't know what it actually shows

[16:10:49] <sudden6> zetok: the diagram shows the public interface that's accessible outside of Core, minus all the Signal-Slot stuff of Qt
[16:11:37] <sudden6> the next step, would be to decide wether we start fresh and build qTox2 or how to divide the work so we can merge it on the fly
[16:12:14] <zetok> that decision depends on the question what is achievable
[16:12:46] <sudden6> it's a hard question I agree
[16:12:57] <zetok> not really
[16:13:17] <sudden6> ??
[16:14:26] <zetok> $resources, $properties_to_uphold, $end_result
[16:16:23] <sudden6> ressources are hard to plan in our case
[16:16:27] <zetok> right now there are not enough of "resources" to make qTox2 while upholding property of something that works
[16:16:41] <sudden6> mhm
[16:17:09] <sudden6> but refactoring on the fly will also bind lots of resources, for long periods of time
[16:17:16] <sudden6> (my guess)
[16:17:27] <zetok> ~yeah
[16:17:40] <zetok> I mean
[16:18:19] <zetok> with how things are being done currently, things would go slow
[16:18:43] <sudden6> what would you change to speed it up?
[16:19:14] <zetok> awareness
[16:19:47] <zetok> i.e. there's currently a pattern where people forget about the PRs they've made/are reviewing
[16:19:57] *** Quits: f10__ (~flo@ ) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[16:20:14] <zetok> which leads to a situation where things are stalled for no good reason
[16:21:25] *** Joins: f10__ (~flo@ )
[16:21:25] <sudden6> mhm, I think the rules here are very strict and slow stuff down
[16:21:36] <zetok> that too
[16:21:39] <sudden6> for example all the rebasing
[16:22:15] <zetok> um?
[16:23:04] <sudden6> if I have >1 PR open, i have to 1. get it reviewed, 2. pass travis, 3 merge it and repeat that with the second PR
[16:24:31] <sudden6> I mean, a PR review is always good and Travis as a very good thing, but in combination with the rebasing it increases the work by a lot
[16:25:07] <zetok> we can switch to `:lgtm_strong:` by default, like it's done in TokTok
[16:25:46] <sudden6> also if I rebased a PR and don't have time to wait + merge, it's very possible some other PR got merged and the work was useless
[16:26:17] <zetok> sleep && gmq $branch
[16:27:12] <zetok> 1 additional command for rebasing
[16:27:26] <zetok> and on top of that, you can put it in a loop
[16:27:52] <zetok> e.g. `loop rebase-my-prs && sleep 1h && gmq $branch`
[16:28:15] <zetok> or, you could just make it a single function
[16:28:26] <zetok> `lgtm $branch`
[16:29:10] <zetok> ↑ note that the loop would stop if rebasing would fail
[16:29:21] <zetok> perhaps s/1h/30m/
[16:30:51] *** Quits: f10__ (~flo@ ) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[16:31:47] <sudden6> yeah, but during this time I can't work on the repo, because it's blocked by the program
[16:32:04] *** Joins: f10__ (~flo@ )
[16:32:07] <zetok> right
[16:32:17] <sudden6> see, I don't think there are no solution to this, but the current ones are unergonomic
[16:33:17] <zetok> um, by throwing in a single `cp -a && cd` in there you'd get a workable repo
[16:35:07] <sudden6> maybe we should create a script like, merge-pr.sh for that
[16:35:18] <zetok> https://gist.github.com/zetok/75d0f1cee17dfb8a5b39a584385db255
[16:36:42] <sudden6> you should really make your scripts public somewhere, I think they'd be helpful for many
[16:37:41] <sudden6> btt, do you have any other ideas how to speadup the development process?
[16:38:21] <zetok> by removing GPG-signatures requirement from commits
[16:38:47] <zetok> this way one could use `merge & rebase` button on gh
[16:38:58] <zetok> alternatively, one could use mergebot like Rust does
[16:39:26] <zetok> i.e. you write just `r+` and bot takes care of merging the PR
[16:40:39] <sudden6> yeah, but that'd be a pretty big security throwback :/
[16:40:47] * sudden6 doesn't like it
[16:41:22] <zetok> ok, then "emulating" mergebot locally

[22:37:36] <helios21> was my mistake. I just opened uTox profile with it and it had no password. Setting a password => crash
[22:37:47] <zetok> huh
[22:38:30] <helios21> I have no idea whats going on there, but I spend 3 hours in a row on all of this, and now just installed utox in order to be able to use tox again
[22:39:28] <zetok> tomorrow I'll see if I can reproduce
[22:40:09] <helios21> I will add libssl versions to bug report

[22:43:31] <zetok> yeah
[22:43:31] <helios21> is it statically linked?
[22:43:33] <zetok> no
[22:43:48] <zetok> qTox doesn't link against openssl directly
[22:43:53] <helios21> hmmm.
[22:43:55] <zetok> it links against sqlcipher
[22:43:58] <helios21> I see
[22:44:02] <zetok> which then links against openssl
[22:44:19] <zetok> it was supposed to crash when setting password?

[22:45:38] <zetok> I don't even have openssl on my system though, so.

[22:48:44] <zetok> there's only 3.3 in stable, and 3.4 in testing
[22:50:12] <helios21> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/4054#issuecomment-270780708
[22:50:48] <helios21> nothing newer available in Debian:
[22:50:50] <helios21> ~> rmadison libsqlcipher0 | cut -c1-72
[22:50:50] <helios21> libsqlcipher0 | 3.2.0-1.1~bpo80+1 | jessie-backports | amd64, arm64, arm
[22:50:50] <helios21> libsqlcipher0 | 3.2.0-2           | testing          | amd64, arm64, arm
[22:50:50] <helios21> libsqlcipher0 | 3.2.0-2           | unstable         | amd64, arm64, arm
[22:50:57] <helios21> nothing newer in Debian experimental
[22:51:26] <zetok> yeah, debian tends to be outdated
[22:52:16] <helios21> https://bugs.debian.org/libsqlcipher0 => shows no known bug, but well
[22:52:46] <helios21> https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/sqlcipher => but well yeah, its outdated
[22:54:20] <helios21> hmmm, maybe its still some distro issue, as there is an ongoing transition related to ssl1.1: https://release.debian.org/transitions/html/ssl1.1.html
[22:54:48] <helios21> but as libsqlcipher already depends on libssl1.1 it should have already been transitioned
[22:54:59] <zetok> sqlcipher is in green though?
[22:55:29] <helios21> I do not find it at all in the table
[22:55:56] <zetok>  /sqlcipher
[22:56:43] <helios21> I only find it in this line
[22:56:45] <helios21> readline7 through amanda, bobcat, cardpeek, edbrowse, freeradius, glusterfs, lnav, profanity, python2.7, python3.5, slurm-llnl, sqlcipher, tarantool, virtuoso-opensource, wpa, xmms2, yuma123
[22:58:02] <helios21> https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=827061 <= release transition bug doesn´t mention libsqlcipher
[22:59:16] <helios21> anyway... it may be a distro issue as qtox worked before, but I am not sure about it
[22:59:41] <helios21> I might need to manually compile libsqlcipher to verify, but this is getting out of hand.
[23:00:08] <helios21> So I may just use utox for now or well qtox with that password less profile that utox created
[23:00:46] <helios21> utox doesn´t seem to use sqlciper, but also not libssl
[23:00:49] <helios21> merkaba:~> ldd /usr/bin/utox | grep ssl
[23:00:49] <helios21> merkaba:~#1> ldd /usr/bin/utox | grep sqlcipher
[23:01:06] <helen> use toxic
[23:02:24] <zetok> helen: `bootstrap.sh` can compile & install sqlcipher
[23:02:29] <zetok> helios21: ↑
[23:02:34] <zetok> tabfail
[23:02:43] <helen> I forgive you
[23:03:06] <helios21> its time for bed for me...
[23:03:30] <zetok> good night :)
[23:04:05] <helios21> I could report a debian bug and refer to the github issue and copy one of the backtraces there, that might clear up whether thats an Debian related issue
[23:09:38] <helios21> hmmm, trying bootstrap.sh but likely will report tomorrow
[23:14:10] <helios21> https://paste.kde.org/pjkqcetzm
[23:14:26] <helios21> sqlcipher0 does´nt compile out of the box on my Debian Sid machine
[23:15:13] <helios21> okay, thats it for today...
[23:15:27] <helios21> hope some time to just have qtox as standard package in Debian
[23:15:29] <helios21> :)
[23:15:31] <helios21> Goodnight
[23:17:43] <helios21> and thx for your help/answers to my reports
