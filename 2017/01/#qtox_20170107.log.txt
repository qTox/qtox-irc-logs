[00:08:37] <Diadlo> sudden6: > different error message
[00:08:58] <Diadlo> I don't change anything related with tox
[00:09:15] <Diadlo> Can you check, do you install toxcore correct?
[00:09:49] <sudden6> what should I check?
[00:09:57] <Diadlo> IDK
[00:10:05] <sudden6> I just did the normal cmake and make -j4 dance
[00:10:38] <Diadlo> and make install ?
[00:10:38] <sudden6> yes
[00:10:42] <Diadlo> Do you specify correct prefix?
[00:10:56] <sudden6> no prefix, default location
[00:11:03] <Diadlo> :(
[00:12:05] <sudden6> apparently everything is installed to /usr/local/lib/

[00:14:29] <sudden6> nothing

[00:17:30] <Diadlo> sudden6: Do you have any ideas?)
[00:18:03] <sudden6> nope
[00:18:45] <sudden6> but I suspect something with cmake, because it works when I use qmake
[00:20:39] <Diadlo> I have an idea
[00:22:46] <Diadlo> Ok. It's wrong
[00:25:12] <Diadlo> sudden6: Can you try TokTok/qTox ?
[00:28:36] <sudden6> no problem there
[00:29:06] <Diadlo> Hm...
[00:31:03] <Diadlo> sudden6: Can you replace this lines https://github.com/TokTok/qTox/blob/master/cmake/Dependencies.cmake#L92:L94 on this https://github.com/Diadlo/qTox/blob/cmakemigration/cmake/Dependencies.cmake#L97:L98
[00:31:04] <Diadlo> ?
[00:31:15] <Diadlo> And try again
[00:31:19] *** Joins: nehik (68eea902@ )
[00:32:01] <nehik> I compiled and tested qTox with this PR https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3976 and everything appears to work.
[00:32:55] <Diadlo> Can you write it on github?
[00:33:29] <nehik> Can do sir :)
[00:33:37] <Diadlo> Also, do you use cross-platform compiling? Or you compile it on windows?
[00:34:59] <nehik> mingw on win
[00:37:32] *** Quits: nehik (68eea902@ ) (Quit: Page closed)
[00:37:40] <Diadlo> Super. I'm not sure, but maybe you can help us with this? https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3372
[00:37:47] <Diadlo> Come on!
[00:38:24] <Diadlo> sudden6: Any success?
[00:38:34] <sudden6> compiling
[00:39:58] <sudden6> no success
[00:40:12] <sudden6> will go afk for now
[00:40:18] <Diadlo> Perfecto
[00:40:47] <Diadlo> `libtoxcore` doesn't works for you, `toxcore` doesn't works for zetok :/
[00:41:11] <sudden6> The systems where it's not working are both openSUSE
[00:41:19] <sudden6> maybe that's a hint
[00:41:54] <Diadlo> s/hint/riddle/
[00:42:17] <Diadlo> I should go. Good night

[21:02:51] <Diadlo> I have a lot of problems with CMAKE and string "NO"
[21:03:12] <Diadlo> It interpret it as empty string

[21:05:43] <robinli> Could go with something like SMILEYS_ENABLED=True/False?
[21:06:18] <zetok> not really
[21:07:41] <robinli> Yeah, just an idea. I don't mess around with CMake much.
