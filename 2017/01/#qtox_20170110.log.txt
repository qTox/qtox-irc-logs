[11:37:17] *** Diadl0 is now known as Diadlo
[11:37:25] <zetok> um?
[11:37:37] <zetok> I was testing it against old version
[11:37:48] <zetok> and now the old version is using 300% CPU :c
[11:38:03] <Diadlo> But without this bug?
[11:38:22] <zetok> well, the bug is not reproducible on old version
[11:38:26] <Diadlo> Ok
[11:38:36] <Diadlo> IDK how to fix it
