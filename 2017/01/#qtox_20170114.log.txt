[11:24:02] <qwebirc321484> hi, i've just downloaded the latest version of qtox for arch.  I'm having issues using it on my multiple displays.  I have 3 screens, my laptop screen (primary), then 2 screens shared over 1 large resolution.  When dragging from primary to the secondary screen(s), qtox loses all resolution and resizes completely.  The text grows ridiculously large and it's unsuable unless on the primary display.  
[11:24:22] <qwebirc321484> I have looked in the settings and I'm unable to see options for changing the font size for the display

[16:07:40] <cali> Hi there
[16:08:11] <cali> It seems that the server that hosts the setup-qtox.exe is broken atm.
[16:08:28] <cali> got any other link?
[16:18:42] <zetok> :|
[16:19:23] <zetok> tux3: ↑
[16:19:51] <zetok> oranges: ↑ do you have access?
[16:20:06] <tux3> lemme check
[16:22:59] <cali> tux3: 504 Bad Gateway.
[16:23:13] <tux3> I've restarted Jenkins, let's see if that does anything
[16:24:10] <cali> Jenkins is too much java.
[16:25:18] <tux3> Ok it should be working again
[16:25:25] <cali> Jenkins is getting ready to work :)
[16:25:35] <tux3> The Jenkins Java process has gone crazy and stopped responding entirely
[16:26:25] <tux3> had*
[16:26:32] <cali> Btw, where are the checksums?
[16:27:20] <tux3> You mean the signatures?
[16:35:37] <cali> tux3: yup.
[16:36:24] <tux3> Probably disappeared because of Jenkins dying. I fixed it
[16:36:34] <cali> Please do.
[16:37:05] <cali> I'm using Tox for a couple of months with people who are too noobs to use IRC or XMPP.
[16:37:27] <cali> At first I was skeptical when I've read that it originated from the 4chan kids board.
[16:37:47] <iphy> it's grown out of that
[16:37:49] <cali> But when I launched it for the first time I was pretty surprised that it was working.
[16:37:57] <cali> and also that it's light.
[16:38:20] <cali> Then on the programming point of view, I took a look at sources and I've found some mess, but I think that can be fixed.
[16:38:33] <iphy> cali: qtox?
[16:38:38] <iphy> or toxcore?
[16:38:47] <cali> Both.
[16:38:50] <iphy> (both are a mess, I'm just curious which mess you saw first)
[16:38:55] <iphy> oh, alright then :)
[16:39:17] <cali> I also remember that the other client, uTox was causing kernel panics.
[16:39:31] <iphy> :D
[16:39:35] <iphy> that's impressive!
[16:39:58] <sudden6> If you're interested to help cleaning up qTox, we just started planning https://github.com/qTox/planning
[16:40:10] <sudden6> Every input is welcome :)
[16:40:46] <iphy> nobody wants to help clean up toxcore :(
[16:40:56] <cali> Yes, I'm quite busy but within the year my comrades and I may start focusing more on instant messengers.
[16:40:59] <iphy> except diadlo <3
[16:41:29] <cali> I think we need Antox to be able to do audio/video.
[16:41:53] <sudden6> tbh, Diadlo is also the only one helping cleaning up qTox ^^
[16:42:45] <zetok> cali: Antox's audio worked last time I've checked
[16:43:19] <zetok> video not yet, bug that's being worked on AFAIK
[16:43:27] <zetok> s/bug/but/
[16:43:45] <cali> I don't like smartphone OSs (except Meego/Maemo but they're dead) so I'm not using it but last time I tried it was hardcore failing.
[16:44:52] <iphy> sudden6: diadlo is a cleaner http://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/mp/nfPtNl_3o48x.gif
[16:45:24] <sudden6> hehe ;)

[20:28:50] <zetok> sudden6: regarding https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/4075 , one can do that already?
[20:38:31] <sudden6> zetok: not the way it is described
[20:38:38] <sudden6> ie like I understand it
[20:39:07] <zetok> oh, right
[20:39:36] <zetok> that won't be supported in qTox
[20:39:47] <sudden6> the way it is described sounds quite nice, but idk it'll be much work
[20:40:18] <sudden6> playing audio right after starting the download sound quite feasible
[20:40:41] <zetok> no, that's not the problem
[20:42:22] <sudden6> `
[20:42:24] <sudden6> ?
[20:44:13] <zetok> automatically playing media → sounds like a bad idea security-wise
[20:44:41] <zetok> streaming audio → sounds like a bad idea …
[20:46:13] <sudden6> not automatically
[20:46:34] <sudden6> but start to play the file while it's in transfer
[20:46:56] <zetok> still bad
[20:47:09] <sudden6> ie the filetransfer widget shows an extra button on known file types to start playing
[20:47:16] <sudden6> why?
[20:48:07] <zetok> security
[20:48:33] <sudden6> well, if you download the file, you're probably going to open it anyway
[20:49:03] <zetok> yes, but they're not opened in the same way
[20:49:28] <sudden6> ?
