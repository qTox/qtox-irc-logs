[07:36:13] <jklyay> hi, my friends and me want a groupbot which invites us all the time to a group chat. is there groupbot which is easy to install? :))
[07:39:51] <zetok> jklyay: there's https://github.com/JFreegman/ToxBot
[07:40:29] <zetok> you'll need to patch it to make it work though
[07:40:48] <jklyay> i'm not a programmer.. how do i use this? :s
[07:41:01] <zetok> https://github.com/JFreegman/ToxBot/pull/11
[07:44:28] <zetok> if it's not clear how to use it, you probably should make an issue about it
[07:44:30] <jklyay> i try this but i think i'm doing something horribly wrong
[07:44:32] <jklyay> http://imgur.com/gReuyWu
[07:45:04] <zetok> oh, windows
[07:45:10] <zetok> it's probably not supported
[07:45:25] <jklyay> oh it's linux only u-u
[07:45:41] <jklyay> well i have a raspberry pi
[07:45:59] <jklyay> does it work on that?

[16:02:40] <iphy> jklyay: yes
[16:05:41] <jklyay> iphy, ok, but how do i find out what causes that error? do i need specific port settings?
[16:07:12] <iphy> jklyay: it usually means you have more than 100 toxes open
[16:08:00] <jklyay> but how can that be, i run toxbot right after restart, iphy
[16:08:53] <jklyay> also the cpu would go crazy if there were multiple clients open
[16:12:15] <jklyay> oh damn, i "sudo make install"ed toxcore two times, first time without libtoxav and after seeing that toxbot needs that (for whatever reason) i compiled it with libtoxav and installed again
[16:12:33] <jklyay> can that be the problem? wouldnt it just overwrite the old one, though?
[16:16:34] <cisc> how is https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3935 going?
