[19:37:43] <vindelschtuffen> zetok, thanks, I have a corrupted save and I'm trying to rescue it
[19:37:51] <zetok> oh, I see
[19:37:58] <vindelschtuffen> it might be a qtox bug actually, all my qtox-created saves are corrupted now and crash every client I try
[19:38:52] <zetok> huh
[19:38:57] <zetok> "corrupted" ?
[19:39:13] <zetok> what hardware / qTox version / OS ?
[19:40:08] <zetok> are the clients that you're trying using irungentoo's toxcore?
[19:41:00] <vindelschtuffen> thinkpad, Git commit: c4fb84e83e1d674f5bf63772e596b0a3b4ed927a, debian testing
[19:41:15] <vindelschtuffen> my system tox lib is c-toxcore
[19:41:42] <zetok> i386 ?
[19:41:44] <vindelschtuffen> and I use qtox, utox, and toxic from git
[19:41:53] <vindelschtuffen> amd64
[19:42:25] <zetok> ok, that's weird
[19:42:52] <vindelschtuffen> qtox gives me a database error in gdb when loading the profile before segfaulting, utox segfaults with "Avatars:Saved avatar file for friend (<some hex here>) too large for tox" 
[19:43:42] <zetok> do you have a working backup?
[19:43:52] <vindelschtuffen> no
[19:44:02] <zetok> :|
[19:44:10] <vindelschtuffen> all the profiles I was using act the same way
[19:44:24] <vindelschtuffen> if I make a new profile with utox and open it in qtox it works
[19:45:49] <zetok> what is the DB error?
[19:47:50] <vindelschtuffen> Thread 9 "qTox Database" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

[20:43:41] <zetok> avatars?
[20:45:30] <sudden6> zetok: look at the updated PR
[20:46:07] <sudden6> basically if you want to do it your way you'd have to keep the password in memory in clear text
[20:46:50] <sudden6> with the object there's only the key, which can't be computed back to the pw
[20:47:28] <zetok> um
[20:47:45] <zetok> there's no difference though?
[20:48:04] <sudden6> significant difference
[20:53:53] <zetok> sudden6: ok, what difference?
[20:54:34] <sudden6> pw -> key works, key -> pw doesn't
[20:56:10] <sudden6> zetok: simply put if you get the key stolen you can encrypt/decrypt that one file
[20:56:32] <sudden6> if you get the pw stolen and it's used elsewhere you're fucked
[20:56:49] <zetok> right

[23:20:15] <nurupo> utox got new domains, one of which is qtox.rip ( http://qtox.rip )
[23:21:55] <nurupo> sounds like utox acknowledges only qtox as its competitor, to the point of paying for the domain and configuring webserver
