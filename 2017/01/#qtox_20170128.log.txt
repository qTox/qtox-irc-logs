[20:40:14] <Diadlo> CMake check only SMILES manualy
[20:40:29] <zetok> oh, I see
[20:41:28] <Diadlo> Also, why sometimes you use `2016-2017` and sometimes `2017`?
[20:41:33] <zetok> ah
[20:41:36] <Diadlo> In copyright
[20:41:37] <zetok> typo
[20:41:44] <Diadlo> Ok
[20:41:51] <zetok> should have been changed to `2016-2017`
[20:42:33] <Diadlo> Why do you delete `export CC="ccache $CC"`?

[21:52:26] <Diadlo> Thanks
[21:54:29] <Diadlo> sudden6, zetok: What do you think about separate qtox launcher (login screen) and qtox client in different apps?
[21:54:42] <zetok> :D
[21:55:12] <Diadlo> What?
[21:55:50] <zetok> well, if a separate app, it would be good to rewrite it in Rust
[21:55:58] <Diadlo> :/
[21:56:00] <zetok> :D
[21:56:06] <sudden6> lol
[21:56:14] <Diadlo> It's time to write tox client in Rust
[21:56:14] <sudden6> one could see that coming^^
[21:56:17] <Diadlo> rTox
[21:56:29] <zetok> retox ;)
[21:56:32] <sudden6> ReTox
[21:56:35] <Diadlo> Ok
[21:56:41] <Diadlo> Is it already exist?
[21:56:56] <zetok> nah
[21:56:58] <sudden6> IDK, was just suggesting a name^^
[21:57:10] <Diadlo> So, what do you think?
[21:57:27] <zetok> with what would separating launcher help?
[21:58:21] <iphy> make one process per conversation, chromium style, and IPC to them to insert widgets into the main window
[21:58:51] <sudden6> Diadlo: fixed
[21:59:12] <Diadlo> iphy: How do you have time to read all the channels? :D
[21:59:25] <sudden6> > process per conversation <- do you want to kill us with work?^^
[22:00:19] <sudden6> I also don't see a real benefit in separating the launcher from the rest
[22:01:38] <Diadlo> For example, qtox will have only one settings instance => we can pass settings by reference without standalone `Settings`
[22:02:34] <Diadlo> I will help to avoid some kind of use-after-free
[22:03:04] <sudden6> I think this is better solved by moving the settings into the database
[22:03:09] <Diadlo> "Click 'Register', fast logout and login again and it will crash" (c) zetok
[22:03:49] <Diadlo> DB reqest per settings read?
[22:04:07] <Diadlo> Or one read in standalone Settings instance?
[22:04:40] <sudden6> zetok: do you intend to comment on #4060? if not I'll unassign you
[22:05:09] <sudden6> Diadlo: read all settings @login and write them on change
[22:05:14] <zetok> sudden6: no idea
[22:05:27] <sudden6> then the problem reduces to syncing global settings
[22:05:31] <zetok> sudden6: do you think that I should look at it?
[22:05:46] <sudden6> zetok: that's why I assigned you :)
[22:05:55] <zetok> oh, ok >.<
[22:05:56] <Diadlo> read all settings < where it will stored?
[22:06:13] <zetok> sudden6: I'll look at it
[22:06:23] <sudden6> thx
[22:06:36] <zetok> sudden6: I mean, I've started looking at it some time ago, but I got distracted
[22:07:17] <sudden6> Diadlo: In memory
[22:07:39] <Diadlo> I.e. how code will get access to settings?
[22:07:41] <Diadlo> sudden6: ^
[22:08:21] <sudden6> Nexus or Profile will hold a reference to it
[22:08:30] <sudden6> or is this a bad idea?
[22:09:02] <sudden6> the better thing would probably be Profil
[22:09:04] <sudden6> e
[22:09:19] <Diadlo> IDK. But I want to avout IoC of bug classes
[22:09:35] <Diadlo> And of cause, avoid of standalone
[22:10:30] <Diadlo> For example: chatform use one settings field. Why it required Nexus instance?
[22:10:39] <sudden6> true
[22:10:52] <sudden6> but it'll require Profile, right?
[22:11:00] <Diadlo> chatform just example
[22:11:27] <Diadlo> But profile seems better
[22:11:52] <Diadlo> Does qTox have class, who need settings, but don't need profile?
[22:12:51] <Diadlo> *has
[22:13:13] <sudden6> 'have' was actually correct^^
[22:13:28] <iphy> what is a nexus?
[22:13:30] <Diadlo> Why?
[22:13:41] <Diadlo> iphy: AFAIK god-class
[22:13:56] <iphy> cool.
[22:13:59] <Diadlo> Yep
[22:14:02] <sudden6> Diadlo: the 3rd person 's' is in 'Does'
[22:14:18] <iphy> did you guys take the "anti-design-patterns" book and implemented all of them?
[22:14:20] <Diadlo> It store Core, Profile, Main widget
[22:14:52] <Diadlo> iphy: WE didn't implement it :/
[22:14:57] <iphy> :)
[22:15:02] <iphy> Diadlo: I know, sorry
[22:15:06] <Diadlo> np :)
[22:15:08] <sudden6> ^^
[22:15:17] <zetok> iphy: AFAIR nexus was supposed to be a platform abstraction, so that qTox could work not only on desktop, but also on android
[22:15:20] <iphy> you're sitting on a pile of old code, just like toktok
[22:15:32] <iphy> zetok: I see
[22:15:41] <sudden6> Our pile is bigger than yours
[22:15:45] <iphy> sudden6: yeah
[22:15:45] * sudden6 bragging
[22:15:47] <iphy> I don't envy you
[22:15:50] <sudden6> :P
[22:16:00] <Diadlo> Lol
[22:16:02] <Diadlo> QString Nexus::getSupportedImageFilter()
[22:16:16] <Diadlo> It's should be exetly in Nexus :)
[22:16:54] <sudden6> Diadlo: the thing with where to store settings
[22:17:14] <iphy> this is a nexus: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/lAcjfpSj/nexus.jpg
[22:17:21] <sudden6> is a problem I face every time I do a bigger programm, but I haven't found a clean solution yet :/
[22:17:35] <iphy> nexus 6 to be precise
[22:17:46] <Diadlo> iphy: http://lh4.ggpht.com/hbj7xrKA2EAB_iobckhciNIVgKeaGLBpaNmFtVorM8-cj4lJK_01k9yJeHIqndtxr7FPNREt2s2-C7dNRMdgx71tQgytraLZDAg=s0
[22:18:00] <iphy> Diadlo: yeah, that too
[22:18:31] <Diadlo> sudden6: I talk not about place to store it
[22:18:36] <Diadlo> settings i.e.
[22:18:53] <Diadlo> But about way to access to it
[22:19:20] <sudden6> yeah, I meant "store in the program structure", that was badly worded
[22:19:30] <Diadlo> Ok
[22:19:46] <Diadlo> It should be stored in Settings class, I think
[22:20:51] <sudden6> In my last project I used also a singleton, but as you mentioned it has problems
[22:20:55] <Diadlo> But code (instead of settings form) will access to settings by const reference
[22:21:48] <Diadlo> I.e. `int& Settings::getVolume()`
[22:22:13] <Diadlo> `Form* form = new Form(s.getVolume())`
[22:22:29] <Diadlo> class Form { private: const int& volume }
[22:22:51] <Diadlo> *`const int& Settings::getVolume()` 
[22:23:42] <Diadlo> Or use small interfaces, as I suggest before
[22:24:32] <Diadlo> May be it will better
[22:24:37] <Diadlo> iphy: What do you think?
[22:25:29] <Diadlo> How code should access to Settings?
[22:25:39] <iphy> no opinion at the moment
[22:25:46] <Diadlo> Ok

[23:47:19] <Emcy> make at least the entire text input box a deterministic colour
[23:47:51] <Emcy> the goal is to have a solid visual cue for not sending things to the wrong people
