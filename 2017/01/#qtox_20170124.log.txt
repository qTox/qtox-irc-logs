[19:50:02] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] Diadlo opened pull request #4090: fix: Add workaround for FreeBSD and ICU (master...fix/freebsd_locale) https://git.io/vMN2X
[20:19:40] <zetok> Diadlo, sudden6: what do you think about closing inactive for months PRs?
[20:19:50] <zetok> Diadlo: btw, commented on the PR ↑
[20:19:57] <Diadlo> Agree
[20:22:57] <Diadlo> zetok: https://github.com/qTox/qtox-irc-logs/blob/d31e9058d9a2c58d77848db3b124225df0575258/2016/10/%23qtox_20161015.log.txt#L162:L175
[20:22:58] <Diadlo> :)
[20:23:14] <zetok> yeah, I remember :)
[20:23:29] <zetok> just making sure that you didn't change your mind like I did ;)
[20:23:39] <Diadlo> Ok
[20:31:03] <Diadlo> zetok: https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/4065
[20:31:06] <Diadlo> LGTM?
[20:31:09] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] zetok opened pull request #4091: docs(MAINTAINING): add info about pull request "expiration date" (master...docs-maint-prclose) https://git.io/vMN65
[20:32:55] <Diadlo> Also, what do you think about merge https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/4064 without test? Why? 1) it's not breaking change 2) -1 PR 3) not sure, that it will be tested in near future
[20:33:44] <zetok> sure
[20:40:53] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] zetok closed pull request #3876: docs(user manual): mention ability to remove entry on ToxMe service (master...docs-man-toxme) https://git.io/vX6KE
[20:42:29] <zetok> Diadlo: perhaps ask in #4064 for someone who has tested to LGTM it?
[20:43:38] <Diadlo> No one test it :)
[20:44:17] <Diadlo> Seems, we need travis with mac os build
[20:45:36] <zetok> build gets tested
[20:45:42] <zetok> but not cmake one
[20:45:55] <zetok> and this script is(?) used only by cmake
[20:46:43] <Diadlo> Yes
[20:46:55] <Diadlo> Time to add docs
[20:47:02] <Diadlo> To cmake
[20:47:24] <zetok> ok
[20:47:53] <zetok> hmm
[20:47:58] <zetok> :s
[20:48:17] <zetok> I wonder what will happen to instructions for windows
[20:49:38] <Diadlo> If I will have enough time I will try to build qTox on windows
[21:05:10] <Saamm> Yaaay o/
[21:06:12] <Saamm> windows version of qTox still isn't the 1.7?
[21:22:58] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] Diadlo opened pull request #4092: CMake docs & scripts (master...chore/cmakeDocs) https://git.io/vMNHG
[21:25:13] <zetok> Diadlo: aren't switches in INSTALL.md invalid?
[21:25:38] <Diadlo> IDK, but it shouldn't :)
[21:25:47] <zetok> err
[21:26:11] <Diadlo> Which one?
[21:27:13] <Diadlo> Better write it to reviewable
[21:27:13] <zetok> Diadlo: https://gist.github.com/zetok/73f0e61ff65d6bf503de93367bf5f0cc
[21:28:11] <Diadlo> What exactly wrong?
[21:28:29] <zetok> cmake switches
[21:28:36] <Diadlo> :|
[21:28:39] <Diadlo> Why?
[21:28:55] <zetok> they differ from qmake ones
[21:30:38] <Diadlo> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/4092/files#diff-7d442b7eb49f5fc377f51e74b291cfc1L54
[21:30:47] <Diadlo> Sorry
[21:31:02] <Diadlo> 54 line
[21:31:49] <Diadlo> It's same. Isn't it?
[21:32:23] <zetok> um, I mean switches, not passing them to the cmake
[21:33:16] <zetok> e.g. `-D DISABLE_PLATFORM_EXT=YES` ← cmake doesn't even have that
[21:33:33] <Diadlo> Hm.. It have
[21:34:07] <zetok> where?
[21:35:07] <Diadlo> Ok. Only `DISABLE_PLATFORM_EXT`
[21:36:04] <Diadlo> It have `SMILEYS`
[21:36:19] <zetok> err, no
[21:36:25] <Diadlo> Yes
[21:36:28] <zetok> `SMILEYS` is the only switch that doesn't differ
[21:36:38] <zetok> everything aside from it differs
[21:37:17] <zetok> and even then, `SMILEYS` was modified in qmake to adjust to cmake AFAIR
[21:37:37] <Diadlo> SMILEYS is undocumented
[21:37:56] <zetok> yeah, time to add the documentation :)
[21:38:08] <Diadlo> Out of the scope
[21:38:13] <Diadlo> Later
[21:38:16] * zetok shrugs
[21:38:25] <Diadlo> IDK where I should specify it
[21:38:27] <Diadlo> etc.
[21:38:29] <Diadlo> Also
[21:38:33] <Diadlo> Good night :)
[21:38:42] <zetok> good night :)
[21:38:43] <Diadlo> I will try tomorrow
