[18:07:51] <newuser> Hi. I'm new user for Tox. I installed qTox on Fedora 24 X64 bit after adding it's repository (openSUSE). I installed it using my package manager Yum extender (DNF) & it ask me for only one dependency which is "libsodium". But I saw many packages in qTox repository still not installed like: toxffmpeg  - tox-libopus  - tox-libsodium  - tox-libtoxcore  - tox-libvpx  - tox-sqlcipher  - toxic !! Is this normal ?? Can qTox work without "tox-l
[18:08:37] <newuser> Please your kind help about this issue.
[18:10:11] <newuser> I launched qTox & register an ID but I'm suspecious about these packages. I'm affraid that there was error in installation.
[18:11:53] <newuser> I uninstall then reinstall qTox but same thing remain. Is this normal ? If yer, so when these uninstalled package used?
[18:13:34] <newuser> I'm suspecious about package "tox-libtoxcore". Is't needed to make qTox work ? Can qTox work without this package ?
[18:16:08] <newuser> Any one please.
[18:17:12] <newuser> I asked these questions in other chanal but they ask me to join this chanal & ask you about this issue.
