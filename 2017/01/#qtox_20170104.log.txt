[00:13:00] <Diadlo> AFAIK it's the same

[00:13:15] <Diadlo> Oh.. No
[00:13:16] <sudden6> Diadlo: also 'ui' doesn't exist und src
[00:13:17] <Diadlo> You a right
[00:13:25] <Diadlo> Lol?
[00:13:37] <Diadlo> Oh
[00:13:41] <Diadlo> Under src -- yes
[00:14:26] <sudden6> Do you know if it's common to store the ui files separate fromt their classes?
[00:16:37] <Diadlo> IDK
[00:16:56] <sudden6> I'll look it up then
[00:17:09] <Diadlo> Ok
[00:21:52] <sudden6> qt creator seems to store the .ui files with the classes
[00:22:11] <sudden6> also it seems to be recommended to use subprojects
[00:22:30] <sudden6> Diadlo: ↑
[00:22:38] <Diadlo> We plan to migrate on CMake
[00:22:51] <sudden6> CMake also supports subprojects
[00:22:54] <Diadlo> Yes
[00:23:10] <sudden6> what's the problem then?
[00:23:31] <Diadlo> I don't know real reason to make `core` (for example) as subproject
[00:24:07] <sudden6> IMO Core is the best example for a subproject
[00:24:08] <Diadlo> I feel, that my opinion is wrong. But don't know an arguments
[00:24:16] <Diadlo> Why?
[00:25:07] <sudden6> when copying Core it should be possible to build for example a QML qTox without much work (antis81 is trying this)
[00:25:33] <Diadlo> Agree
[00:25:46] <sudden6> it's (should be) totally independent
[00:26:13] <Diadlo> Seems most part of our modules should be a subprojects
[00:26:22] <Diadlo> May be all
[00:26:26] <sudden6> mhm
[00:26:34] <sudden6> I agree
[00:27:00] <sudden6> but maybe make that after the cmake transistion?

[00:32:04] <Diadlo> I.e. if someone delete all content, can we restore it?
[00:32:14] <sudden6> there's a button on the top right
[00:32:27] <sudden6> also import export is possible
[00:32:49] <sudden6> we'll export it when we're finished for today
[00:33:31] <Diadlo> I think we should share plan in out qTox site/blog
[00:33:37] <Diadlo> *our
[00:34:03] <sudden6> would be a good idea
[00:34:26] <sudden6> but I think we should work on it for a bit, before doing that
[00:35:00] <Diadlo> Of course
[00:36:31] <Diadlo> Timeline seems not good. Because many things can be made parallel
[00:37:24] <sudden6> we missed a module "chatlog"
[00:37:58] <sudden6> seems like the only well designed UI class^^

[00:45:09] <sudden6> for now we use them inconsistently
[00:45:21] <Diadlo> Where we use it?
[00:45:41] <Diadlo> Or you talk about `std`?
[00:46:01] <Diadlo> Oh.. Seems we have namespaces
[00:46:12] <Diadlo> Never seen it before
[00:46:20] <Diadlo> *them
[00:46:37] <Diadlo> I'm not against
[00:47:06] <sudden6> IIRC in initramfs PR they were forbidden
[00:47:26] <sudden6> For now I don't see an advantage of using them
[00:47:29] <Diadlo> AFAIK, usually use namespace for avoiding name conflicts
[00:47:49] <Diadlo> Between projects
[00:48:09] <sudden6> ok, so don't use them?
[00:48:47] <Diadlo> Ok

[08:05:37] <zetok> Diadlo: just some thought food
[08:06:42] <zetok> Diadlo: KDE in general is crappy when it comes to stability/usability, KDE4 → KDE5 made it even worse; this is not what one would want qTox to take inspiration from
[08:07:50] <zetok> Diadlo: as for big refactor branches, aside from looking above, this idea was tried several times already for qTox, not just by antis81, but before that by DaSpirit – none of the attempts were successfully merged.
[08:08:44] <zetok> if you want to go with big refactoring, it's not like there something stopping you from doing that
[08:10:05] <zetok> there's a problem though with simple physical limitations of human brain, that simply increase chance of bugs – the more code you change, the higher chance that something will be done wrong, since one is not able to keep all the relevant things in memory at the same time
[08:10:29] <zetok> in other words, huge refactoring branches will introduce regressions, and a lot of them at that
[08:11:02] <zetok> with that in mind, it might be *very* hard to fix all the regressions and end up merging the code
[08:11:55] <zetok> the worst case might be that all the regressions will be too much to get things merged, and story of big refactoring changes will repeat itself, and another attempt will end up not getting merged
[08:12:38] <zetok> on the other hand, small changesets might take some time to get merged, but they are getting merged
[08:12:51] <zetok> now, the current process of merging things is far from being efficient
[08:13:18] <zetok> so if things are too slow, you might want to look into a way to speed things up
[08:13:25] <zetok> Just some though food.

[10:15:54] <Chiitoo> zetok: I imagine that would mean there is no qTox 2 if it were to take inspiration from KDE5, heh...
[10:16:04] <zetok> there will be
[10:16:24] <zetok> just refactoring the code is not a reason to bump major version number
[10:16:27] <Chiitoo> (Was just jokingly referring to the 'there is no KDE5' thing.)
[10:17:10] <Chiitoo> (So qTox would probably be split into different parts with their own versions.)
[10:17:30] <Chiitoo> Seen anything like this before?  https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=594162
[10:17:34] <zetok> also, KDE3 is still alive AFAIK
[10:17:39] <Chiitoo> I have a feeling I had, but couldn't find anything.
[10:17:52] <Chiitoo> (Or they were related to USB cameras.)
[10:18:08] <Chiitoo> I believe it's available, yeah.
[10:18:29] <zetok> right, time to remove 1.5 from Gentoo
[10:18:49] <Chiitoo> They also seem to have issues with 1.6.
[10:19:05] <zetok> mm
[10:19:08] <zetok> what about 1.7 ?
[10:20:04] <zetok> error seems familiar
[10:21:53] <Chiitoo> I'll probably ask them, and if it's still happening, maybe suggest they open an issue about it.
[10:22:55] <zetok> there were people with that in logs (on distros other than Gentoo), but I couldn't reproduce
[10:23:18] <Chiitoo> Never had the issue either, as far as I can remember.

[20:14:32] -qtox-git-spam- qTox/master 6bad4ad sudden6: chore(style): add coding style file for Qt Creator
[20:28:07] <cenysor> the gpg key of the opensuse respository is expired. what should I do?
[20:31:39] <robinli> cenysor: https://qtox.github.io/blog/2016/11/13/Expired-GPG-and-v1.6.0-release.html
[20:31:48] <robinli> There's a fix there. :)
[20:34:00] <cenysor> robinli: thak you!
[20:34:10] <cenysor> *thank
[20:36:36] <robinli> Anytime. :)
[20:45:41] *** Quits: x_ (~x@ ) (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[20:50:25] <cenysor> robinli: ah, I have two further questions: Is it possible to automatically log in on startup? And why do I not get automatic group invites from some bots?
[20:55:13] <robinli> cenysor: As far as I know, you can't automatically log in on startup. Maybe without a password and with the start on boot option? It does say "(current profile)" in the tooltip.
[20:55:40] <robinli> 2nd, I've no idea. Hang around and wait for a different dev to answer. Sounds like a problem with the bots to me, but I really don't know.
[20:56:00] <cenysor> robinli: ok, thanks!
[20:56:32] <sudden6> cenysor: If you have no password set you can enable automatic login through the checkbox in the login window
[20:56:49] <robinli> sudden6: Cool. I didn't know that. :)
[20:57:11] <robinli> Always used a password. :P
[20:57:16] <zetok> wiki & bot
[20:57:23] <zetok> bot could make things better
[20:57:28] <cenysor> sudden6: ah, ok, thanks!
[20:57:31] <sudden6> for the second question, I don't think anybody has programmed their bots to send automatic group invites
[20:58:28] * zetok sighs
[20:58:29] <cenysor> sudden6: mh, I get invited to a group chat on startup by one bot :/
[20:58:50] <sudden6> ok, that's new to me^^ which one is it?
[20:59:13] <zetok> the successor of /g/punk probably
[20:59:26] <cenysor> sudden6: LainBot
[20:59:32] <zetok> that's the one then
[21:00:08] <sudden6> oh ok, didn't know of it until now^^
[21:00:40] <zetok> WTF
[21:00:46] <zetok> why did qTox remove my avatar
[21:00:51] <cenysor> btw the qGroupbot doesn't have an active groupchat
[21:01:21] <zetok> regression is between 335b408278808624a504079302c583fecd6ec07a and 03fe946c2a06b0ad49e38c30e907a35bc243ee92
[21:01:35] <sudden6> zetok: that could be fallout from introducing toxpk and toxid
[21:01:45] <zetok> -.-
[21:01:51] <zetok> how it was even tested?
[21:03:07] <sudden6> probably the avatar cache is different because different data is hashed...
[21:03:35] <sudden6> zetok: does it work if you set the avatar again?
[21:03:48] <zetok> I'm not going to set my avatar again
[21:04:59] <zetok> first I'd need to find it
[21:05:53] <zetok> it was removed from `avatars` dir -.-"
[21:05:56] <sudden6> it's probably still in the cache
[21:06:13] <sudden6> ok? that shouldn't happen
[21:08:12] * zetok sighs
[21:08:20] <zetok> time to restore stuff from backup
[21:19:03] <sudden6> zetok: does the encrypted db still work?
[21:19:12] <zetok> no idea
[21:19:17] <sudden6> I can't spot anything obvious in the commits
[21:19:53] <zetok> ha
[21:20:03] <zetok> 2 regressions in price of 1
[21:20:36] <sudden6> what's the second?
[21:21:04] <zetok> second was fixed
[21:21:12] <zetok> (the missing friendlist)
[21:22:25] <zetok> sudden6: e07d8d358f6fc890a77e029aa230b69bdecd325e ← offending commit
[21:22:29] <zetok> (via bisect)
[21:22:38] <zetok> do you want me to make an issue?
[21:23:26] <sudden6> I'll see if I can find something right now
[21:24:03] <zetok> uh
[21:24:08] <sudden6> so does it work if you set a new avatar? ie does it stay?
[21:24:09] <zetok> that's a 800+ lines diff
[21:24:44] <sudden6> yes, it wasn't really possible to split it
[21:27:23] <zetok> nope
[21:27:42] <zetok> sudden6: avatar gets successfully erased every time
[21:27:58] <zetok> just from settings though
[21:28:03] <sudden6> thanks, that's something I can debug
[21:35:33] <zetok> made an issue
[21:39:59] <Diadlo> What do you think about glob'ing in CMake?

[22:43:56] <sudden6> writing the header file
[22:44:02] <Diadlo> Why not UML?
[22:44:11] <sudden6> couldn't download umbrello, opensuse repo is down...
[22:44:24] <Diadlo> Wow
[22:44:44] <sudden6> or atleast the one I configured
[22:45:26] <sudden6> ok, it's up again
[22:47:18] <Diadlo> Also, we can create block-schema to show classes interaction

[22:49:27] <sudden6> I'll start with ToxPk as warmup
[22:49:39] <Diadlo> Ok
[22:50:30] <sudden6> seems like I need a tutorial for this...
[22:51:05] <Diadlo> Click `class` button on the top panel
[22:51:19] <Diadlo> Click on the white space
[22:51:25] <sudden6> yep I already have the class there
[22:51:33] <sudden6> how do I add a function?
[22:51:41] <Diadlo> Select `pointer` (1st tool)
[22:51:47] <Diadlo> And double click on class
[22:52:07] <Diadlo> Or double click in `Tree view`
[22:52:18] <sudden6> ah, thx I think I got it :)
[22:52:25] <Diadlo> np :)
[22:52:43] <Diadlo> AFAIR Umbrello can generate code
[22:53:09] <sudden6> can it also read in existing code?
[22:53:18] <Diadlo> IDK
[22:54:04] <sudden6> apparantly it can :D
[22:54:33] <Diadlo> How?
[22:54:40] <Diadlo> Code -> Import ?

[23:06:38] <_sudden6_> note, that I didn't do anything yet
[23:07:04] <Diadlo> I was hoping that it imported ~connection
[23:07:38] <_sudden6_> maybe it can but I can't display it yet
[23:07:51] <_sudden6_> I've to play a little bit with the program :)
[23:08:22] <Diadlo> It displayed by default (you can create it by red lines on the top)
[23:08:54] <Diadlo> Maybe Code haven't connections
[23:08:56] <Diadlo> *Core
[23:09:48] <_sudden6_> it does
[23:10:07] <_sudden6_> I just dragged CoreAv into the diagram and it made a connection
[23:10:36] <_sudden6_> but the connection is only on members
[23:38:49] <sudden6> Diadlo: could there be problems if multiple classes call functions of c-toxcore?
[23:40:02] <Diadlo> What kind of `problems`?
[23:40:41] <sudden6> I don't know, race conditions, deadlocks, pointer dereferences...
[23:40:51] <sudden6> but I think it will be save
[23:41:23] <Diadlo> It depend not of classes, but of usage :)
[23:41:28] <Diadlo> I think it can't
[23:42:47] <sudden6> I imagine something like Core->getFriendList()-

[23:51:38] <Diadlo> FindFriend is not related with c-toxcore
[23:51:59] <Diadlo> It shouldn't call c-toxcore functions, etc.
