[08:05:53] <reBrain> hi
[08:06:28] <reBrain> I'm on 1.7.0 and everytime I restart the client on win 7 it autoupdates but doesn't change the last commit so it seems that it doesn't update at all
[08:06:31] <reBrain> why is that?
[08:07:32] <reBrain> why does it autoupdate everytime i restart when there are no new updates?
[08:07:42] <reBrain> is this a bug?
[08:20:41] <zetok> yep
[08:21:18] <reBrain> should I open an issue?
[08:23:55] <zetok> I guess
[08:24:37] <reBrain> oke
[08:24:42] <reBrain> so how you guys doing?
