[15:46:29] <LittleVulpix> tux3: what's wrong with qtox update again? :o
[15:46:51] <tux3> LittleVulpix, what, is it broken again? :/
[15:47:12] <LittleVulpix> it keeps redownloading every time I start qtox
[15:47:27] <LittleVulpix> log says it needs to update 2 files
[15:47:36] <LittleVulpix> but then
[15:47:59] <LittleVulpix> :0 : Warning: QFile::open: File (C:/Users/<pix>/AppData/Roaming/tox//update/./qtox.exe) already open
[15:47:59] <LittleVulpix> net/autoupdate.cpp:514 : Critical: downloadUpdate: Can't save new update file, aborting...
[15:48:53] <tux3> That is extra weird
[15:49:02] <LittleVulpix> Windows 7, UAC disabled
[15:49:10] <tux3> I remember someone had the same problem
[15:49:22] <tux3> Check in task manager if you don't have a second qtox instance running?
[15:49:31] <LittleVulpix> no qtox process running
[15:49:46] <LittleVulpix> I'd notice, it wouldn't let me start it since I'd have no profile for it
[15:53:04] <LittleVulpix> tux3: checking for the handle in process explorer, there is nothing holding it
[15:54:13] <tux3> Do you have an antivirus running by any chance?
[15:54:26] <LittleVulpix> tux3: yes, you don't ?
[15:54:56] <tux3> Nope, but maybe it's the antivirus keeping it open and preventing the updater from replacing it
[15:55:09] <tux3> I don't really know though, it's very strange
[15:55:14] <LittleVulpix> tux3: Maybe, but this is a company laptop, can't turn the AV off.
[15:55:41] <tux3> Either way we need to fix this in qTox, but it would be good to know the cause
[15:55:55] <tux3> Can you reproduce it?
[15:56:04] <LittleVulpix> tux3: literally every start
[15:59:05] <tux3> If process explorer says it's not open and Windows says it's open, I'm not sure what to make of it
[15:59:21] <tux3> Does it still happen after a reboot?
[15:59:40] <LittleVulpix> tux3: it's been happening the past week
[15:59:44] <LittleVulpix> I only just now noticed
[16:06:00] <LittleVulpix> tux3: Lucky for you it also happens on my home PC where I can disable the AV. Let's see.
[16:06:15] <tux3> Lucky me :)
[16:07:09] <LittleVulpix> Nop
[16:07:11] <LittleVulpix> Same problem
[16:07:14] <LittleVulpix> AV disabled
[16:08:15] <LittleVulpix> inb4 it's _yet another_ problem that you cannot resolve via update and people must redownload and reinstall qtox again
[16:08:17] <LittleVulpix> :D
[16:12:10] <LittleVulpix> It just sounds like the updater doesn't close the file before trying to do <whatever> with it :p
[16:12:42] <LittleVulpix> If you watch the interface of qtox, you see the progressbar go, then - for a split second - you see "restart qtox to apply update", but then it disappears and nothing happens when you restart qtox
[16:13:15] <LittleVulpix> other than the same thing repeating itself.
[16:18:02] <tux3> But then processexplorer should pick it up, so I'm not sure what's happening here

[16:38:42] <LittleVulpix> tux3: Well I'm at your disposal, I can reproduce it on two completely different systems
[16:38:54] <LittleVulpix> Though I have to travel home in about 30 minutes
[16:39:05] <zetok> LittleVulpix: update from which version to which?
[16:39:14] <tux3> LittleVulpix, thanks a lot. I'll have to think about it because right now I have no idea
[16:39:27] <LittleVulpix> zetok: from 1.7.0 to... whatever it gives me.
[16:39:34] <zetok> Hmm.
[16:39:53] <LittleVulpix> Interestingly one of them says toxcore version 1.3.0, the other says 1.2.0
[16:40:07] <LittleVulpix> both can't update with the same issue though.
[16:44:13] <sudden6> zetok: what should I add to the docs to make the use case more clear? "
[16:44:14] <sudden6> use a ToxEncrypt object and
[16:44:16] <sudden6>   * encrypt() or decrypt() when you have to encrypt or decrypt more than once
[16:44:17] <sudden6> "
[16:44:27] <sudden6> is a pretty clear hint on the use case IMO
[16:44:36] <zetok> sudden6: yes, but not an exact use case
[16:45:32] <sudden6> I don't know any exact use case
[16:45:43] <sudden6> as the answer is "it depends" :/
[16:45:49] <zetok> ok
[16:45:56] <zetok> so the answer is "there are no use cases"
[16:46:21] <sudden6> there are use cases for both
[16:46:50] <zetok> there is a use case for password-based, and there is a possibility of use-case for derived key
[16:46:52] <sudden6> if you need to encrypt/decrypt often it's better to use the object, else the static functions
[16:47:06] <zetok> yes
[16:47:13] <zetok> question is: do you need to?
[16:47:30] <zetok> and if you need to, why?
[16:47:33] <LittleVulpix> tux3: alright. Well you know where to find me if you need anything from me. I can also probably set up a virtual machine for you with teamviewer or something of the sort :D Anyway, gonna be afk for like 2hrs now
[16:47:35] <sudden6> ???
[16:47:45] <tux3> LittleVulpix, thanks!
[16:47:52] <sudden6> zetok: do I need to what?
[16:48:01] <zetok> >if you need to encrypt/decrypt often (â€¦)
[16:48:38] <sudden6> well when saving the *.tox save you need to encrypt on every change
[16:48:56] <zetok> That's how it should be done..?
[16:49:18] <sudden6> yes
[16:49:48] <zetok> How is password not sufficient?
[16:49:59] <sudden6> derived key == password
[16:50:16] <zetok> not quite
[16:50:18] <sudden6> only that password derivation is computing power intensive
[16:50:26] <zetok> it's a lot easier to mess up when using derived key
[16:50:44] <sudden6> and by using the object you cache the derived key in RAM
[16:50:50] <sudden6> to save computation power
[16:51:10] <zetok> yeah, that doesn't sound good
[16:51:22] <sudden6> that's how it's donw
[16:51:26] <zetok> sudden6: how much of the computation power is saved?
[16:51:45] <zetok> sudden6: yeah, I've heard that you were interested in refactoring ;)
[16:52:13] <sudden6> password derivation has to be in the order of 10ms - 100ms to be effective
[16:52:34] <sudden6> (really slow for computers)
[16:53:09] <zetok> doesn't really sound like a problem
[16:53:51] *** Joins: f10__ (~flo@ )
[16:54:21] <sudden6> well, if you're concerned that the key could stay in RAM, there's a deleter that will clear(?) + free it
[16:54:27] <sudden6> every time
[16:54:46] <sudden6> I'll be away for ~1h
[16:55:19] <zetok> I'm more concerned about messing things up
[16:55:41] <zetok> password is easier to use, so it has smaller chance of messing up
[16:56:40] <nurupo> lol
