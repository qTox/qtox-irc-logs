[12:16:55] <sudden6> zetok Diadlo what about removing old historykeeper?
[12:17:03] <sudden6> in 1.9
[12:17:39] <Diadlo> Agree. But `TODO: remove backwards compatibility in 2018`
[12:17:43] <Diadlo> :/
[12:18:05] <sudden6> yep, that's why I'm asking...
[12:20:55] <sudden6> Diadlo: what do you mean with https://github.com/qTox/planning/issues/1 ?
[12:21:29] <Diadlo> I mean, that we should move user aliases from settings to db :)
[12:22:05] <sudden6> ok, I think it's a good idea :)
[12:22:24] <sudden6> what do you think of the UML model i did?
[12:22:39] <sudden6> you mentioned something, but we didn't talk afterwards
[12:24:02] <zetok> sudden6: when was historykeeper deprecated?
[12:24:11] <zetok> (version, that is)
[12:24:15] <sudden6> I don't remember
[12:24:22] <Diadlo> I think it can be better
[12:24:25] <Diadlo> UML
[12:24:42] <Diadlo> But haven't good ideas
[12:25:12] <sudden6> I also think it could be better, but didn't have time to improve it
[12:25:16] <Diadlo> +
[12:25:22] <Diadlo> Ok. I will try improve
[12:25:24] <Diadlo> *to
[12:25:27] <sudden6> great :)
[12:25:51] <zetok> sudden6: is it really troublesome to keep that code?
[12:26:16] <Diadlo> zetok: It's garbage
[12:26:21] <sudden6> zetok: yes, it prevents the removal of some very bad code
[12:26:26] <Diadlo> +
[12:26:53] <zetok> well then, remove it if you need to
[12:27:06] <sudden6> ok, will submit a PR shortly
[12:28:23] <Diadlo> Also, I'm tried to integrate QML in our code :)
[12:28:33] <sudden6> how was it?
[12:29:19] <sudden6> I'll merge https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/4127 ok?
[12:29:46] <Diadlo> 1) It's very hard to write QML code, when you can't do it. So I still haven't 'Settings About' form
[12:30:07] <Diadlo> 2) But I successfully integrate red box :)
[12:30:13] <zetok> sudden6: script is missing a copyright header
[12:31:45] <sudden6> ok, wait I found another thing
[12:32:00] <zetok> also missing `#!/bin/bash`
[12:32:36] <sudden6> shouldn't that be irrelevant if he doesn't use bash specific stuff?

[21:56:49] <Diadlo> About unsigned (-1)
[21:57:02] <Diadlo> Here should be ssize_t, but it's unsupported by windows
[22:00:46] <Diadlo> sudden6: I suggest to use size_t and -1. Are you ok with it?
[22:01:02] <sudden6> I don't really know if that's a good way or a bad way, what would be the alternatives?
[22:01:14] <Diadlo> 0 is a valid result
[22:01:44] <Diadlo> We can use MAX_UINT. But it's more unintuitive, than -1
[22:01:46] <Diadlo> IMO
[22:02:31] <sudden6> can't the function not just return 0 if there was an error? since it seems to be a valid result it can just print an error message to the log
[22:03:23] <Diadlo> Caller, can't validate result
[22:04:13] <Diadlo> In this case
[22:05:02] <Diadlo> Also, `network` shouldn't print anything
[22:08:48] <sudden6> well, when using 0 as invalid value, you'd just use the information of what kind of problem happened
[22:09:05] <Diadlo> 0 is valid value
[22:09:09] <Diadlo> It empty array
[22:09:15] <Diadlo> *It's
[22:09:25] <sudden6> because if you pass valid data it will result in a non empty array
[22:09:42] <Diadlo> Where you found this information?
[22:10:11] <sudden6> that's what I would expect from the function
[22:10:36] <Diadlo> It's wrong
[22:10:41] <sudden6> why?
[22:12:16] <Diadlo> sudden6: https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/pull/461/files#diff-585a09a7eea194bebb4c25786e4a0cd1R1222
[22:12:25] <Diadlo> + 10 lines
[22:13:41] <Diadlo> Ok, you are won. I will change it on int
[22:14:32] <sudden6> lol, don't forget to put a protection against overflow in place
[22:15:05] <Diadlo> What kind of protection do you want?
[22:16:01] <sudden6> count has to be limited to < INT_MAX
[22:16:18] <sudden6> because signed overflow is undefined in C
[22:16:28] <sudden6> (I read the standard this morning)
[22:16:35] <Diadlo> Gtz
[22:16:50] <sudden6> unsigned int overflow is actually defined by the standard
[22:16:58] <sudden6> I was wrong on this one
[22:23:53] <Diadlo> sudden6: Done
[22:31:39] <sudden6> Diadlo: if I read that correctly, you only resolve the hostname, is this on purpose?
[22:33:21] <sudden6> also what do you think of the cleanup PRs I sent to qTox?

[22:55:22] <sudden6> > Also, seems your htonl implementation is wrong <- you forgot one line
[22:56:17] <sudden6> ok, I forgot one line
[22:56:18] <sudden6> sorry
[22:57:20] <Diadlo> Do you really think, that 4 AND with different shift duration is more readable?
[22:58:01] <Diadlo> I'm still not fully understand how it works
[22:59:02] <sudden6> Diadlo: I updated the comments
[22:59:11] <sudden6> I forgot to copy one line somehow
[22:59:19] <sudden6> maybe that makes it more clear
[22:59:33] <Diadlo> Nope
[23:00:20] <sudden6> basically you shift the uint32 to the position where the byte should be and the mask out the others
[23:00:30] <sudden6> pretty standard code in the embedded world
[23:00:36] <Diadlo> Yes. I know
[23:01:04] <Diadlo> It's hard to describe, nevermind
[23:01:18] <sudden6> what exactly don't you understand?
[23:01:21] <Diadlo> Done
[23:01:33] <Diadlo> > It's hard to describe, nevermind
[23:04:16] <sudden6> Diadlo: in the last line there are some backticks that don't belong there
[23:05:18] <Diadlo> Also, you may be interested in, that both solution in most cases will be compiled to `bswap`
[23:05:27] <sudden6> Diadlo: I know
[23:05:52] <Diadlo> backticks removed
[23:06:14] <Diadlo> Good night
[23:06:27] <sudden6> it's just that these shifts are well defined everywhere, but not all computer architectures can address bytes like in your variant

[23:16:30] <sudden6> Diadlo: http://stackoverflow.com/a/99010 this basically explains it
[23:17:53] <Dako300> I have qTox, and group calls with more than three people keep dropping people out and cutting each other off randomly. I forked qTox and added a bitrate slider for individual and group calls (modified c-toxcore to have changeable group bitrates), and the problem persists down to the lowest bitrate possible (6kbps). Would this be a problem with qTox or with c-toxcore?
[23:18:17] <sudden6> Dako300: that's hard to answer
[23:18:25] <sudden6> do you have the needed bandwith?
[23:18:33] <sudden6> upload and download?
[23:18:34] <Dako300> I should
[23:18:42] <sudden6> all of your people?
[23:19:12] <Dako300> Yeah, they all run the fork at 6kbps
[23:19:25] <sudden6> what's the bandwith of everyones internet connection up and down?
[23:19:26] <Dako300> Except for the group bot, but that shouldn't matter, right
[23:20:12] <Dako300> I don't know his, but it is good enough for an individual call at 64kbps to work just fine
[23:20:26] <Dako300> Mine is 20 down 3 up, and the bot is on my LAN
[23:20:47] <sudden6> yeah, but for a groupchat, I think everybody needs the upload to stream the audio to everybody else
[23:20:57] <sudden6> (I'm not 100% sure on this though)
[23:21:34] <Dako300> That makes sense, but I can't imagine bandwidth is the problem here at 6kbps
[23:21:48] <sudden6> that said we have tested qTox with 3-4 people on one groupchat and streaming audio
[23:22:08] <Dako300> what was the network topology there?
[23:22:39] <sudden6> three connections over the internet and one person running two qTox instances locally
[23:23:06] <sudden6> I think all with >2Mbit up and down, around the world
[23:23:23] <Dako300> that's weird then...
[23:24:35] <sudden6> do you use Wifi?
[23:24:41] <Dako300> Do you know what the ping times were for each of them?
[23:24:46] <sudden6> because I had problems with it
[23:24:56] <sudden6> nope, don't know
[23:25:03] <Dako300> I used both WiFi and a wired connection, and they both are very choppy
[23:25:22] <sudden6> have you tried other clients than qTox?
[23:25:40] <Dako300> No, can you recommend a client that supports Tox group chats?
[23:26:43] <sudden6> I think uTox and toxic would be the ones to test
[23:27:07] <Dako300> I will check out uTox, Toxic doesn't support audio chats (only text)
[23:27:13] <Dako300> *group chats
[23:27:21] <Dako300> from what I read at least
[23:27:22] <sudden6> please report back what you find out
[23:27:24] <Dako300> ok
[23:27:51] <sudden6> also, if your PR makes it into toxcore, it would be nice if you could submit the qTox part
[23:28:20] <sudden6> to the qTox repo
[23:28:36] <Dako300> I will, but i'm having some trouble with the default settings
[23:29:01] <sudden6> what troubles?
[23:29:44] <Dako300> The value that a new (tacky) function returns is different than what the bitrate slider is set to in the settings. I have to change it and change it back for it to take effect
[23:30:15] <Dako300> I haven't developed in Qt before, so i'm just feeling my way around at this point
[23:31:23] <sudden6> feel free to ask questions here :)
[23:31:32] <Dako300> I will
[23:32:07] <Dako300> How are default settings managed in Qt?
[23:32:41] <Dako300> I have a bit of a problem with locks
[23:33:02] <sudden6> I don't think they are managed, we do it manually in qTox I think
[23:33:09] <sudden6> will have to take a look though
[23:33:27] <Dako300> ok, I think I found something like that somewhere
[23:34:13] <sudden6> src/persitence/settings.cpp is the file you need
[23:34:18] <Dako300> ok
[23:34:52] <Dako300> I already have something there
[23:34:58] <sudden6> for example, L366
[23:35:15] <sudden6> "typingNotification", true <- true is the default value
[23:35:18] <Dako300> on line 298 (on my end)
[23:35:24] <Dako300>         audioBitRate = s.value("bitRateSlider", 64).toInt();
[23:35:46] <Dako300> oh wait, I think I'm stupid
[23:35:46] <sudden6> yep, that's the right way
[23:35:47] <Dako300> ...
[23:36:00] <sudden6> but 64 sounds low
[23:36:13] <Dako300> 64kbps is the default compression level for qTox
[23:36:28] <Dako300> Group chats are even lower at 32 for mono and 16 for setero
[23:36:30] <Dako300> *stereo
[23:36:35] <sudden6> oh, it's in kbps
[23:36:54] <sudden6> I thought it's bps
[23:37:02] <Dako300> nah
[23:37:40] <sudden6> would be interesting if 512bps Opus is still understandable
[23:37:51] <Dako300> Opus doesn't work below 6kbps
[23:38:07] <sudden6> mhm
[23:38:08] <Dako300> Although speech doesn't sound too bad at that level
[23:41:10] <Dako300> Turns out I have completely forgot to import the settings from the Settings namespace
[23:42:49] <Dako300> that should fix it...
[23:43:33] <Dako300> sudden6: I can't submit the pull request yet because the group bit rate functio isn't implemented outside of my fork, but I will if and when the c-toxcore pull request is accepted
[23:43:52] <sudden6> I didn't expect anything else :)
[23:43:58] <Dako300> good
[23:47:11] <Dako300> This might be more of a question for toktok, but is it possible to speed up the discovery of new nodes?
[23:47:45] <sudden6> idk, do you mean connecting to the DHT or to your friends?
[23:47:54] <Dako300> DHT
[23:48:27] <Dako300> I saw an open issue on the c-toxcore github about connecting to and bootstrapping from local instances of Tox, which would be pretty cool since I run a dedicated ToxBot
[23:48:36] <sudden6> If I shutdown qTox cleanly, I'm connected again in a few seconds
[23:49:07] <sudden6> LAN discovery is automatically used in qTox, that should work if you're in the same subnet
[23:49:12] <Dako300> weird then, it takes me around five or ten
[23:49:24] <sudden6> seconds or minutes?
[23:49:30] <Dako300> seconds
[23:49:42] <sudden6> ok, i still wouldn't call that long
[23:49:46] <Dako300> didn't know LAN discovery was a thing in qTox, it would work with any instance of Tox right?
[23:50:04] <sudden6> it should™
[23:50:06] <Dako300> yeah, well it gets pretty annoying when I have to keep restarting it to try a new test build
[23:50:26] <Dako300> probably not a big deal tho
[23:50:45] <sudden6> try adding echobot@toxme.io to the testing account, maybe that helps
[23:51:15] <sudden6> since tox tries to connect to friends, this should speed things up
[23:51:29] <sudden6> and echobot runs on a server
[23:51:35] <Dako300> nice, thanks
[23:52:59] <Dako300> most of my testing happens in group chats, so it might not work
