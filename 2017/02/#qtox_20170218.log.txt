[22:08:30] <parasite_> Hello, I use qtox since a while, and sometimes I encounter a problem.
[22:08:30] <parasite_> Both me and a contact are online, but we appear offline.
[22:08:30] <parasite_> Once one has restarted qtox, we appear online for each other.
[22:08:30] <parasite_> I would like to know, is it a known problem?
[22:08:30] <parasite_> What can I do to solve this?
[22:08:31] <parasite_> Is qtox can automaticaly reconnect to the tox network after an adsl interruption?
[22:22:45] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] tux3 merged more_often_broken_than_not into master: https://git.io/vD7N4
[22:28:20] <zetok> parasite_: https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/237
[22:29:08] <zetok> parasite_: current workaround in qTox is to click on `Reconnect` in settings :|
[22:30:21] <parasite_> zetok, thanks you for you response
[22:33:16] <parasite_> zetok, If I have an adsl interruption, I should click on the "reconnect" button which is in the settings? This is not automatic?
[22:36:28] <zetok> making it automatic would only make detecting bug harder
[22:36:41] <zetok> bug should be fixed instead of working around it
[22:37:13] <zetok> primary function of the `Reconnect` button is to apply new network settings
[22:57:46] <parasite_> zetok, oh yes I understand, but this is not the point, firtly my ask was about this bug, but now I would like to know how qtox deals with network interruption

[23:00:37] <zetok> it doesn't really
[23:00:55] <zetok> all that stuff is (supposed to be) handled by toxcore
[23:02:58] <zetok> right now toxcore doesn't seem to handle that stuff well
