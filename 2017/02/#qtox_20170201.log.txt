[15:34:31] <sudd3n6> zetok: If we switch to gitlab, we should have our own backups apparently https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/02/01/gitlab_data_loss/
[15:34:51] <zetok> sudd3n6: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GCK53YDcBWQveod9kfzW-VCxIABGiryG7_z_6jHdVik/pub
[15:35:42] <zetok> >So in other words, out of 5 backup/replication techniques deployed none are working reliably or set up in the first place.
[15:35:43] <zetok> :D
[15:36:36] <zetok> sudd3n6: anyway, regarding the backups, that's the plan :)
[15:37:36] <Chiitoo> Moving to gitlab, eh?
[15:38:09] <zetok> mm
[15:38:20] <zetok> with gitlab one at least can backup the data
[15:40:14] <Chiitoo> Better get my pull request(s) in swiftly, heh.
[15:41:25] <zetok> before github melts down ;)
[15:48:33] <Chiitoo> Kinda creepy timing.  Someone just said 'rofl @ gitlab' in a completely different channel.  :S
