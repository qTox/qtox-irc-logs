[19:32:25] <Diadlo> > <sudden6> it seems to be impossible to tell qtcreator to put the braces on the same line as the control structure
[19:32:26] <Diadlo> Lol
[19:32:53] <sudden6> yeah, that's what I thought too
[19:33:02] <sudden6> but I couldn't find an option :/
[19:33:13] <Diadlo> I'm too
[19:35:25] <Diadlo> sudden6: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22846739/full-customization-of-qt-creator-coding-style#24756329
[19:35:54] <Diadlo> Seems it's better replacement for default QtCreator style
[19:36:02] <sudden6> Diadlo: nice, that would make the file obsolete
[19:36:37] <Diadlo> So we should add it to the docs and remove xml
[19:36:59] <sudden6> yep
[19:37:21] <sudden6> didn't know that qtcreator had a plugin system O_o
[19:37:47] <Diadlo> I'm hear about it, but never seen before :)

[19:40:18] *** Joins: pcre (~quassel@ )
[19:40:20] <sudden6> zetok: accidentally clicking cancel
[19:40:41] <zetok> that doesn't sound urgent
[19:41:06] <sudden6> urgent, as in more important than the style
[19:41:10] <zetok> i.e. right now qTox is not even able to transfer files bigger than just a few MB
[19:41:43] <zetok> so even if there is an accidental cancel, it's not a big problem
[19:42:09] <sudden6> yeah, but the current stuff works, why not merge it and then improve the style
[19:42:16] <sudden6> gradually improving
[19:42:32] <zetok> gradual improvement would have buttons with proper size
[19:42:40] <zetok> not a regression
[19:43:16] <Diadlo> We need to migrate from sqlchipher :/
[19:43:32] <zetok> :D
[19:43:38] <zetok> Diadlo: to TES ?
[19:43:44] <Diadlo> Cross compilation of it -- go through the hell
[19:43:47] <sudden6> noooooooo
[19:43:48] <Diadlo> What is TES?
[19:43:55] <zetok> toxencryptsave
[19:43:58] <Diadlo> The Elder Scrolls?)
[19:44:03] <zetok> also ;)
[19:44:14] <sudden6> old historykeeper used that approach, it's horrible
[19:44:19] <Diadlo> Lol?
[19:44:26] <Diadlo> It's only for old historykeeper?
[19:44:32] <sudden6> no
[19:44:41] <zetok> Diadlo: the problem with TES is that data was being lost constantly
[19:44:54] <sudden6> but it created an sql database which was then encrypted using TES
[19:44:57] <zetok> at least that's what tux3 said as a reason to move to sqlcipher
[19:45:03] <sudden6> loose power loose everything
[19:45:21] <zetok> actually
[19:45:36] <zetok> sudden6: this could be worked around by having backups of the DB
[19:45:45] <Diadlo> I'm start from a ~joke
[19:46:04] <zetok> and while at it, there should be also backups of the profile
[19:46:06] <Diadlo> Because I think it's not the first problem
[19:46:07] <sudden6> zetok: a backup of every write?
[19:46:35] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/1534
[19:47:52] <zetok> what do you think about keeping last 10 "versions" as backups?
[19:48:04] <Diadlo> For me issue unclear. Is backup before every change?
[19:48:15] <Diadlo> *is unclear
[19:49:05] <zetok> mv profile.tox profile.tox.bak-$(unix_timestamp) && touch profile.tox
[19:49:15] <zetok> ~kinda
[19:49:32] <Diadlo> It seems like wipe of profile
[19:49:58] <zetok> "backup" shouldn't constitute a new write, just rename current "working" files, and new files would be created on write
[19:50:02] <Diadlo> AFAIR, backup is `cp`
[19:50:27] <Diadlo> Hm...
[19:50:45] <Diadlo> <zetok> Diadlo: the problem with TES is that data was being lost constantly
[19:50:51] *** Quits: bashrc (~motters@ ) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[19:50:52] <Diadlo> > constantly
[19:51:14] <zetok> yeah, there were quite a lot of bug reports about lost history
[19:51:38] <Diadlo> But history saved out of the profile
[19:52:13] <zetok> well
[19:52:20] <zetok> I just know about bug reports
[19:52:25] <Diadlo> Ok
[19:52:29] <zetok> before migration, there were a lot of them
[19:52:41] <zetok> after, almost none, or none
[19:53:27] <Diadlo> sqlchipher used to store history
[19:53:41] <Diadlo> So profile backup is unrelated issue
[19:54:03] <zetok> um
[19:54:19] <zetok> "profile" is about user data, not just the .tox files
[19:54:26] <Diadlo> Ok
[19:54:38] <sudden6> see you later
[19:55:04] <Diadlo> Bye
[19:55:36] <zetok> cya
[19:58:33] <Diadlo> zetok: #4135 and #1025 ~same?
[19:58:41] <Diadlo> Can we close one?
[19:59:57] <zetok> um, #1025 is about font
[20:00:09] <Diadlo> Font is part of the style
[20:00:12] <Diadlo> Isn't it?
[20:00:22] <zetok> um
[20:00:29] <zetok> I don't think so
[20:00:32] <Diadlo> Ok
[20:01:06] <zetok> regardless, I was wondering whether #4135 should be closed
[20:01:25] <zetok> i.e. qTox should have support for themes
[20:01:37] <zetok> question is, how the theming should be done?
[20:02:41] <Diadlo> I'm not sure, that qTox should/could support system themes
[20:02:56] <Diadlo> But could use it own themes
[20:03:03] <Diadlo> Like plugins)
[20:03:06] <zetok> ok
[20:03:34] <zetok> so supporting system themes is out of question
[20:03:50] <zetok> as for supporting qTox-specific themes, why not
[20:04:03] <Diadlo> I'm not sure, that it's right
[20:04:38] <zetok> um?
[20:04:45] <Diadlo> Ignore system theme
[20:05:09] <zetok> we do what we can
[20:05:17] <zetok> if we can't support system themes, we don't
[20:05:32] <Diadlo> I'm not sure, that we can't
[20:05:37] <zetok> oh, ok
[20:05:51] <Diadlo> But not sure, that we can ;)
[20:05:58] <zetok> :D
[20:06:15] <Diadlo> 1) qTox use non-standart widgets
[20:06:40] <Diadlo> I.e. list of friend != list of any other QWidgets in another Qt applications
[20:07:28] <Diadlo> 2) I theory we can drop own styles and use system ones, but...
[20:07:35] <Diadlo> https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2612812/22854464/d5c8bfa6-f077-11e6-9f70-822bc7a3c02b.png
[20:07:50] <Diadlo> That's why I do not want)
[20:08:09] <zetok> user(s) want :D
[20:08:34] <Diadlo> What do you think?
[20:09:25] <zetok> I think that this should be looked at from maintenance PoV, i.e. what would be easier to maintain
[20:09:30] <Diadlo> As far as I can imagine, we can select one of the 2 ways: only system theme / only own theme (exclude simple UI elements)
[20:09:41] <zetok> but I don't know anything about that stuff
[20:09:46] <Diadlo> What is PoV?
[20:09:51] <Diadlo> Point of view?
[20:09:51] <zetok> point of view
[20:09:53] <Diadlo> Ok
[20:10:43] <Diadlo> We can use reference to the Tox UI guidelines
[20:11:12] <Diadlo> Do we have official guidelines?
[20:11:20] <zetok> https://github.com/Tox-Clients/Tox-UI
[20:11:31] *** Joins: bashrc (~motters@ )
[20:11:39] <Diadlo> Perfectly!
[20:12:10] <Diadlo> Can you close the issue?
[20:14:51] <zetok> so using system theme is too hard?
[20:15:42] <Diadlo> It's out of the Tox UI guidelines. Isn't it?
[20:15:55] <zetok> yeah, like some other things
[20:16:11] <Diadlo> :)
[20:16:27] <zetok> UI guidelines are only as good as long there is a designer working on them
[20:16:51] <zetok> Tox UI haven't had a designer working on them for years
[20:17:21] <Diadlo> Ok
[20:17:31] <zetok> the situation with themes is that people will want them in qTox, and will want to customize themes
[20:18:39] <zetok> and when it comes to customized themes, people usually want themes to apply to their whole system, instead of every application separately
[20:18:54] <Diadlo> Yes...
[20:19:11] <zetok> so it's a question of whether we can support that
[20:19:53] <zetok> if we can't support system themes, "next best thing" would be used, i.e. qTox-specific themes
[20:20:47] <zetok> the reason why I would want to close #4135 is because I think that supporting system themes would be too hard
[20:21:20] <Diadlo> Honestly, I do not know

[23:18:32] <sudden6> zetok: I suggest removing the custom coding style file from 4191
[23:19:02] <sudden6> When I've time I'll write instructions on how to include the clang-format in qtcreator
[23:19:23] <sudden6> but this could take some time and I don't want the PR to be blocked because of this
[23:19:26] <zetok> um?
[23:19:41] <zetok> sudden6: you mean the .clang-format file?
[23:20:03] <sudden6> no, the qTox-coding-style.xml from /tools/
[23:20:33] <zetok> it never got to be a part of the PR
[23:20:58] <sudden6> yeah, but after the PR it's wrong -> remove
[23:21:24] <zetok> oh, so you mean remove as a part of the PR
[23:21:29] <sudden6> yes
[23:22:31] <zetok> I can remove it as a part of #4191, but it can be done in a separate PR, perhaps the one with instructions for using clang-format in qtcreator ?
[23:23:07] <zetok> unless you want the repo to be atomic
[23:26:08] <sudden6> zetok: I probably won't have time to write that up and test it for this week, so I think it's better to remove it now and add it later
[23:26:09] <zetok> removed
[23:26:36] <sudden6> also, it's not exactly the most important thing
[23:27:03] <zetok> btw
[23:27:49] <zetok> Diadlo, sudden6: you might want to run `find src/ -iname '*.cpp' -o -iname '*.h' -exec clang-format -i -style=file {} +` with the #4191 applied to make sure that you're ok with the changes
[23:30:46] <zetok> after #4191 there will be 2 PRs, first one with those changes, and the second one with a change to travis to check whether clang-format was run before committing
[23:30:47] <sudden6> zetok: I think the find command doesn't work
[23:31:04] <zetok> um?
[23:31:50] <sudden6> or clang-format doesn't work
[23:32:00] <zetok> what's the error?
[23:32:06] <sudden6>     if (sodium_init() < 0) // For the auto-updater
[23:32:07] <sudden6>     {
[23:32:09] <sudden6>         qCritical() << "Can't init libsodium";
[23:32:10] <sudden6>         return EXIT_FAILURE;
[23:32:12] <sudden6>     }
[23:32:31] <sudden6> I thought braces should be on the same line?
[23:32:47] <sudden6> maybe it doesn't work with comments?
[23:32:47] <zetok> yeah, it doesn't restructure those braces :|
[23:33:27] <zetok> it's not about comments
[23:33:44] <zetok> (perhaps in this case it is)
[23:34:16] <zetok> but from what I've seen, clang-format doesn't affect braces in control statements
[23:34:18] <sudden6> also the find command doesn't execute clang-format for me
[23:34:54] <sudden6> Profile::~Profile()
[23:34:55] <sudden6> {
[23:34:57] <sudden6>     if (!isRemoved && core->isReady()) {
[23:34:58] <sudden6>         saveToxSave();
[23:35:00] <sudden6>     }
[23:35:01] <sudden6> here it worked
[23:35:10] <zetok> huh, weird
[23:35:35] <sudden6> I think the find command is the problem, and maybe comments on the same line as if's
[23:36:26] <zetok> I don't think that it's about `find` command
[23:36:49] <sudden6> yeah, not the problem with the if
[23:37:05] <sudden6> but the command you posted doesn't change any source file for me
[23:37:24] <zetok> ?!
[23:37:31] <zetok> this is weird
[23:37:35] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] Diadlo opened pull request #4205: fix(core): Ignore online connection status (master...fix/status-spam) https://git.io/vyTNy
[23:37:38] <zetok> it does change stuff for me
[23:38:24] <zetok> but the weird thing is, clang-format doesn't change all the relevant stuff when ran via find
[23:38:38] <zetok> i.e. it didn't change braces for control statement
[23:38:55] <zetok> but I've just run it directly on a file and it changed them
[23:38:59] <sudden6> zetok: maybe it doesn't find the config file?
[23:39:11] <zetok> well
[23:39:24] <zetok> I only ran clang-format via find before today
[23:39:33] <zetok> and config changes were being reflected
[23:40:27] <sudden6> ok, I have to manually run it for files to see changes
[23:40:48] <zetok> :/
[23:40:56] <zetok> apparently `find` doesn't find all the files
[23:42:13] <Diadlo> Why column limit is 100?
[23:42:50] <zetok> IIRC initramfs said that 80 would result in a lot of code being reformatted
[23:42:57] <sudden6> Diadlo: in initramfs PR it was agreed that 80 is narrow for todays screens
[23:43:31] <Diadlo> 100 is too many for split-screen :/
[23:43:35] <Diadlo> Nevermind
[23:43:49] <sudden6> dual screen ftw :P
[23:44:03] <Diadlo> Already
[23:44:11] <Diadlo> One scree for browser
[23:44:25] <zetok> ok, `clang-format -i -style=file $(git ls-files src/)` works
[23:44:26] <Diadlo> Why we indent case in switch?
[23:45:01] <zetok> ok, so can we revert to 80 chars per line?
[23:45:14] <Diadlo> Feel free to leave it 100
[23:45:25] <sudden6> I also like 100 more

[23:45:54] <zetok> this is going to conflict with everything :3
[23:45:58] <sudden6> but the "case" inteded really doesn't look that good
[23:46:06] <sudden6> *intended
[23:46:15] <Diadlo> Can we disable it?
[23:47:06] <zetok> yes
[23:47:42] <Diadlo> Lol https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/src/chatlog/chatlog.cpp#L812

[23:48:07] <zetok> > IndentCaseLabels: true
[23:48:29] <zetok> perhaps `// maybe` should be added below

[23:50:34] <sudd3n6> sorry, got disconnected, what did I miss?
[23:50:51] *** sudd3n6 is now known as sudden6
[23:51:28] <zetok> ok, now `case` is no longer indented
[23:51:33] <Diadlo> <Diadlo> Can we disable it?
[23:51:33] <Diadlo> <zetok> yes

[23:53:22] <Diadlo> zetok: Please, don't forget update updater/
[23:53:40] <sudden6> zetok: was 2 spaces indent intended?
[23:54:25] <zetok> sudden6: where?
[23:54:55] <Diadlo> Wow
[23:55:08] <sudden6> zetok: everywhere it seems
[23:55:17] <Diadlo> Be careful with `clang-format -i -style=file $(git ls-files src/)`
[23:55:27] <Diadlo> It updates .ui
[23:55:32] <zetok> oh
[23:55:44] <Diadlo> And .rc
[23:56:33] *** Quits: bashrc (~motters@ ) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[23:56:45] <sudden6> it didn't do anything to the .pro file for me

[23:57:44] <Diadlo> Is it possible to ignore formatting like this?

[23:58:49] <zetok> :|
[23:59:18] <Diadlo> Not so bad
[23:59:26] <zetok> well
[23:59:40] <Diadlo> It's possible => good :)
