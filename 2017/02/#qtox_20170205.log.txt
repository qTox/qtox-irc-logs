[02:42:14] <Dako300> hey, we found a fix for that group audio problem
[02:42:31] <Dako300> turns out more OpenAL outputs were needed to facilitate all of the peers at one time
[02:43:44] *** Joins: agrecascino (~agrecasci@ )
[02:43:54] <Dako300> yo agrecascino, hows it goin?
[02:44:27] <Dako300> he took care of the OpenAL stuff, and i'm working on the bit rate stuff
[02:44:30] <Dako300> the github URL is https://github.com/Dako300/qTox
[02:44:40] <agrecascino> ^we fixed a thing
[02:45:23] * Dako300 high five
[02:45:25] <Emcy_> there is a codec that works with a few hundred bits ps
[02:45:35] <Dako300> Emcy_: which one?
[02:45:45] <Emcy_> 'codec2'
[02:46:18] <Dako300> sounds cool. I wanted to go balls to the wall with a personal project with just simulating a vocoder
[02:47:35] <Emcy_> i bet you could go really low if your codec is just reproducing phonemes
[02:48:10] <Dako300> Recording would be pretty hard (maybe)
[02:49:54] <Emcy_> you gonna submit your findings are a pr?
[02:50:27] <Emcy_> i doubt the slider would make it in. Normies hate sliders.
[02:51:55] <Emcy_> openal causes lots of problems for tox it seems
[02:52:09] <agrecascino> can anyone here build windows qtox?
[02:53:46] <Dako300> Emcy_: the pull is a two part system
[02:54:37] <Dako300> The group bit rate isn't actually configurable by vanilla Tox, so I had to fork Tox to make a function to change the bitrate, and I will make a PR for the group chat bitrate for qTox when that gets accepted
[02:54:51] <Dako300> however, it all works from c-toxcore and qTox on my GitHub
[02:55:21] <Dako300> I'm thinking about changing the slider tho, but it fits in fine with the volume slider so I doubt they would mind (too much)
[02:57:03] <Emcy_> toxcore should handle bitrates itself
[02:57:26] <Emcy_> it has a function to iirc but its broken so clients disable it
[02:58:01] <Dako300> it only has a function for calls to a person, group calls don't have such a function (that's the only function my pull request creates)
[02:58:02] <Emcy_> tox users should absolutely not be expected to fuck around with bitrates are stuff normally
[02:58:41] <Dako300> yeah, but i'm hoping a tox client would have a place where the "max" bandwidth for a stream is, and adjust the bitrate automatically from that
[02:59:20] <Dako300> Emcy_: the c-toxcore pull request is https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/pull/464
[02:59:34] <Emcy_> its locked at 64kpbs iirc
[02:59:42] <Dako300> The qTox doesn't have a pull (c-toxcore deps), but the fork is Dako300/c-toxcore
[03:00:06] <Dako300> Emcy_: group calls were either locked at 32kbps for mono or 16kbps for stereo input
[03:00:20] <Emcy_> if the bandwidth recommendations actually worked and the next opus version which is supposed to sounds a lot better at 32kpbs
[03:00:26] <Emcy_> it would be pretty good
[03:00:56] <Emcy_> you have to consider tox can only use constand bitrate modes also
[03:01:18] <Emcy_> so it should just step up and down through them
[03:01:37] <Dako300> I used every bitrate from 6 to 64 in the groupcall and it seemed to work just fine
[03:01:52] <Dako300> I even switched them on the fly during a call (which was pretty dank)
[03:02:17] <Emcy_> audio is rarely goning to be a problem
[03:02:21] <Emcy_> video is different tho
[03:02:55] <Dako300> I can see valid use cases for slow data connections, large group calls, and bad wifi
[03:03:20] <Dako300> of course the changes would be abstracted out by the client, but it still needs the infrastructure
[03:05:51] <Emcy_> the repo maintainer is harcore about code review and also is away for 2 weeks
[03:07:26] <Dako300> I can tell the former from other pull requests
[03:08:52] <Dako300> Emcy_: are you a maintainer yourself? If so, would you support this PR?
[03:09:13] <Emcy_> i dont write code
[03:09:30] <Dako300> Do you like the idea at least?
[03:09:58] <Emcy_> what exactly is the idea
[03:10:16] <Dako300> the pull request
[03:10:26] <Dako300> adding a bit rate slider (and also fixing group calls)
[03:10:38] <Dako300> "fixing" is allowing more than one person to speak at a time
[03:11:34] <Emcy_> the slider i wouldnt support. Toxcore should tell the client whats going on there instead
[03:11:50] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] yurivict opened pull request #4137: fix(font): Made font changes in settings apply on screen instantly. (master...font-update) https://git.io/vDc65
[03:11:57] <Emcy_> the fixes i dont see why not
[03:12:13] <Emcy_> i think they were gonna replace openal anyway
[03:12:20] <Emcy_> for a good reason
[03:13:52] <Dako300> Emcy_: toxcore doesn't tell qTox about which bitrate to use on standard calls (set as a constant in qTox), is there a reason why group calls are an exception I'm not thinking about
[03:19:49] <Emcy_> it should and it tried. But the bitrate recommendations in toxcore are broke.
[03:19:55] <Emcy_> i didnt know group audio was different
[03:20:55] <Dako300> individual calls with different bitrates work fine, and the bitrates there are specified in toxav_answer or toxav_call (I think that's the function name)
[03:21:28] <Dako300> Those seem to work fine, but there isn't an OTF method of changing that (maybe it shouldn't be implemented as OTF in the first place?)
[03:23:20] <Emcy_> isnt that handled by opus
[03:24:17] <Dako300> Bitrate is handled by Opus, but the toxav_ calls are essentially just wrappers to Opus functions with sanity checks, and that seems to work fine
[03:25:09] <Emcy_> hm ok

[03:28:05] <Dako300> that pull request might be a problem

[03:30:35] <agrecascino> 3 minutes ago
[03:30:45] <Dako300> srsly would there be a merge problem?
[03:30:53] <agrecascino> it literally did what i did
[03:31:16] <Dako300> how "literally" are we talking here?
[03:31:20] <agrecascino> as in
[03:31:25] <agrecascino> it's like the same patch
[03:31:26] <agrecascino> but not
[03:31:36] <Dako300> is it plagiarism?
[03:32:09] <agrecascino> no
[03:32:15] <Dako300> okay
[03:32:21] <agrecascino> it's just someone who read IRC chat
[03:32:35] <Dako300> that makes sense
[03:32:41] <agrecascino> and finally made a pull request for the same thing
[03:32:43] <Dako300> I want to push what changes I did make, but just comment out the group bit rate stuff
[03:32:51] <agrecascino> no seriously who are you

[04:49:32] <Dako300_> Actually, there is no second branch

[04:52:34] <Dako300_> I did that on my main version
[04:52:43] <zetok> "main" is broken
[04:53:01] <Dako300_> i git reset hard to the last relevant commit I had made on my fork

[05:05:19] <Dako300_> what did the -D in git branch do?
[05:05:33] <zetok> forcefully deletes branch that hasn't been merged
[05:06:08] <zetok> generally, `-d` should be used, unless you do want to delete non-merged branches
[05:06:30] <Dako300_> oh fug
[05:06:41] <Dako300_> I didn't follow the git commit specification
[05:06:50] <zetok> don't worry
[05:06:55] <Dako300_> ok
[05:06:57] <zetok> do you have now a single commit?
[05:07:00] <Dako300_> yeah
[05:07:03] <zetok> ok
[05:07:06] <Dako300_> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/4139
[05:07:16] <zetok> `git commit --amend`
[05:08:48] <Dako300_> ok, that's taken care of
[05:08:54] <Dako300_> zetok: quick question
[05:09:12] <zetok> just ask, don't ask to ask ;)
[05:09:41] <Dako300_> I have some code commented out there that only works on a forked (and staging PR) version of c-toxcore. Would there be a problem with that commented code being there even though c-toxcore hasn't pulled it?
[05:10:24] <Dako300_> It works and compiles fine with the standard version of c-toxcore, but the commented code is technically incorrect
[05:10:30] <zetok> Dako300_: it would be the best to move that code to a separate PR
[05:12:53] <Dako300_> zetok: ok
[05:13:44] <zetok> btw, `git commit -a --amend` can be used to add changes to your latest commit
[05:13:55] <Dako300_> oh, that's cool
[05:15:25] <Dako300_> zetok: are there any other standards I should meet for code contribution?
[05:15:37] <Dako300_> besides gitting gud
[05:17:41] <Dako300_> zetok: thanks for the help
[05:17:45] <Dako300_> do you use Bitcoin?
[05:18:03] <zetok> kinda
[05:18:16] <Dako300_> well you deserve at least some of it for the help IMHO

[09:09:27] <sudden6> zetok: is there reason why some of the translations are moved, but still need to be retranslated?
[09:09:53] <zetok> lupdate
[09:10:24] <sudden6> yeah, but why does it delete perfectly fine translations?
[09:10:46] <zetok> they're no longer used
[09:11:43] <sudden6> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/4140/files#diff-c549f0d2748e2c7d228fa9fb32faeeafL2646 removed
[09:12:08] <sudden6> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/4140/files#diff-c549f0d2748e2c7d228fa9fb32faeeafR2807 added again as unfinished
[09:12:29] <zetok> ah
[09:12:31] <zetok> code moved
[09:13:03] <zetok> current .ts files aren't really what lupdate/lrelease work on
[09:14:07] <zetok> .ts are stripped, so that diffs would be smaller, without stripping they would include some other data that refers to position of the translation in the code
[09:14:30] <sudden6> aha
[09:14:48] <zetok> "unfinished" is simply added to translations that probably are still correct, but since code has been moved/altered they should be re-checked
[09:15:00] <sudden6> ah, ok :)
[09:17:21] <sudden6> is there anything that needs to be done for 1.8?
[09:17:43] <sudden6> I think we need a changelog + blog post
[09:17:50] <zetok> I was wondering about https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/4138
[09:18:03] <sudden6> me too
[09:18:31] <sudden6> I have no idea what it does
[09:18:36] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] zetok pushed  new commits to master: https://git.io/vDc7e

[09:19:08] <zetok> it's supposed to fix audio issues when there are >=3 participants in an audio groupchat
[09:19:29] <zetok> IIRC it has been broken for quite some time
[09:20:11] <sudden6> did you test this?
[09:20:28] <zetok> no
[09:21:20] <zetok> I wonder how it would work in a scenario where you have more than one audio groupchat, each with >=3 active audio participants.
[09:35:40] <zetok> sudden6: do we want to play "better safe than sorry" with that PR?
[09:35:52] <sudden6> what do you mean?
[09:36:22] <zetok> well, there's no real harm if it gets merged for 1.9, given that stuff has been broken for so long
[09:36:44] <sudden6> yeah, I wouldn't merge it for 1.8
[09:36:52] <zetok> ok
[09:36:58] <sudden6> probably won't pass review that fast anyway
[09:37:26] <sudden6> I think the sudden influx of PRs is very interesting
[09:38:23] <zetok> well
[09:38:30] <zetok> it just means that qTox is alive and well
[09:39:00] <sudden6> yep, and I like that :)
[09:39:17] <zetok> i.e. getting back where it was before tux3 got MIA
[09:39:56] <zetok> oh, there's also https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/4108
[09:40:30] <sudden6> what's the problem with it?
[09:40:47] <zetok> generally looks ok, but version updating seems to be now limited to osx
[09:41:17] <sudden6> limited to or limited on?
[09:41:33] <zetok> limited to
[09:41:49] <sudden6> that's not good
[09:42:04] <sudden6> it shouldn't break things for already working platforms
[09:42:16] <zetok> there's dev-ruby/plist that I can install, so I'll see if it provides what is needed
[09:44:11] <sudden6> I don't see where this PR removes version update support from windows and linux
[09:45:02] <zetok> >defaults
[09:46:47] <sudden6> still don't get it
[09:48:09] <zetok> isn't that a osx-only thing?
[09:48:21] <sudden6> do you think #4119 is ready?
[09:49:02] <sudden6> it's also in an osx only script, so I see no problem
[09:49:28] <zetok> #4119 seems to be ready
[09:49:36] <zetok> script though is not osx-only
[09:49:50] <sudden6> ah, that's what you mean
[09:50:12] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/4108/files#diff-5c14beea957fcf1edaa6f63c76eecd4eR24 ← no os requirements
[09:50:44] <sudden6> will it ever be ran on non osx?
[09:50:53] <zetok> err
[09:51:02] <zetok> how else would you update version?
[09:52:07] <sudden6> so you want to be able to cross compile qTox for osx?
[09:52:21] <zetok> yes, but that's not relevant right now
[09:52:48] <zetok> originally script was supposed to update the version just before compiling on target os, so it would have been fine to keep it osx-only, but that didn't work too well
[09:54:04] <zetok> instead, version would be duplicated in files, and updated just before the release, and for that script would need to work on at least linux
[09:54:18] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] sudden6 closed pull request #4119: Made clipboard operations work the same on all OSes. (master...clipboard) https://git.io/vDsuY
[09:54:21] <zetok> right now it's osx-only
[09:54:22] <sudden6> but, wasn't that the thing vit fixed?
[09:54:36] <sudden6> (updating on target osx)
[09:55:46] <zetok> it was part of changes
[09:57:07] <zetok> if cmake stuff from the PR is good, it's good to merge, and then eventually I'll make it work the way it should
[09:57:40] <sudden6> I'll leave this one up to you to decide

[13:09:26] <sudden6> Diadlo: yes, but even if it's unused it should be noted in the function documentation that it doesn't do it

[15:11:25] <zetok> I mean
[15:11:25] <Diadlo> I.e. you want to enable it if it's possible?
[15:11:54] <zetok> regarding unity tray, if someone explicitly enables it, they probably want to build with it
[15:12:19] *** Joins: Dako300_PHONE (~Dako300@ )
[15:12:20] <zetok> and right now even if it's enabled, qtox would build without support for it if dependency is not found
[15:12:33] <zetok> I think that it would be better if qTox failed to compile instead
[15:14:05] *** Joins: albel727 (~albel727@ )
[15:14:10] <Diadlo> Add "REQUIRED"?
[15:14:25] <Diadlo> I'm agree with you
[15:14:27] <zetok> yeah, but only for unity stuff
[15:14:34] <Diadlo> Why?
[15:14:51] <zetok> because it takes effort to enable it
[15:14:58] <Diadlo> Right
[15:15:00] <zetok> i.e. someone wants to build with support for GTK
[15:16:10] <zetok> since qTox is Qt, the default is that people don't want to build with GTK stuff enabled, but if they have required deps on their system, there's little to no reason to not build it with GTK support
[15:16:17] <zetok> ldd /usr/bin/qtox | wc -l
[15:16:17] <zetok> 124
[15:16:22] <zetok> ldd /usr/bin/qtox | wc -l
[15:16:22] <zetok> 146
[15:16:34] <zetok> Guess which one was build with GTK support. :|
[15:17:09] <Diadlo> Hm.. same file, different ldd output? WHAT?
[15:17:48] <zetok> um, I ran that command before and after rebuilding qTox
[15:17:53] <Diadlo> Ok
[15:18:32] <zetok> >libncursesw.so.6
[15:18:43] <zetok> Makes one wonder why qTox links to that.
[15:18:57] <Diadlo> ldd /usr/local/bin/qtox | wc -l
[15:18:58] <Diadlo> 184
[15:19:02] <Diadlo> Lol :)
[15:19:07] <zetok> bloat :P
[15:20:25] <Diadlo> libssh.so.4
[15:21:21] <Diadlo> What the fuck is this?
[15:22:42] <zetok> one of dependencies on your system is build with support for that
[15:23:05] <zetok> ldd /usr/bin/qtox | grep ssh -c
[15:23:05] <zetok> 0
[15:23:06] <zetok> :P

[17:23:33] <Diadlo> zetok: Do you have any ideas, how to fix problem with gtest + cmake + travis ?
[17:24:03] <zetok> what is the problem/
[17:24:04] <zetok> ?
[17:24:27] <Diadlo> cmake can't found gtest package
[17:24:39] <Diadlo> But it works fine on my machine
[17:25:09] <zetok> you're using arch, right?
[17:25:17] <Diadlo> Yes
[17:26:22] <zetok> >search_dependency(GTEST PACKAGE GTest OPTIONAL)
[17:26:29] <zetok> shouldn't that be required?
[17:26:47] <Diadlo> If I make it required cmake just will fail
[17:30:03] <Diadlo> Is it working on your local machine?
[17:34:41] <Diadlo> If we will can't fix it, I will rewrite it for ctest
[17:35:06] <Diadlo> It works at least for toktok
[17:35:13] <zetok> which package is supposed to provide `gtest` ?
[17:36:25] <zetok> http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/amd64/google-mock/filelist
[17:43:32] <Diadlo> Yes. I have it in install-list
[17:44:23] <Diadlo> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/4110/files#diff-bb12e4f9ffac2ee8421553bc4d5423dcR34

[17:47:42] <zetok> well, dunno
[17:47:49] <Diadlo> :/
[17:48:04] <zetok> it looks to me like `gtest` is not provided
[17:48:16] <Diadlo> gmock too
[17:48:41] <zetok> there is `gmock_gen`
[17:49:25] <Diadlo> Where?
[17:49:35] <zetok> http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/amd64/google-mock/filelist
[17:49:45] <Diadlo> Hm...
[17:51:03] <Diadlo> What do you think, which way is better. Add travis gtest build or change test system?)
[17:51:49] <Diadlo> http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/gmock_gen.1.html
[17:52:35] <zetok> if the test system is simply better, then adding it to travis is the way to go
[17:57:57] <Diadlo> IDK
[17:58:22] <Diadlo> It has useful mock system

[23:14:56] <sxsa> He can see me and himself, but I can only see myself. Audio works both ways
[23:15:25] <Emcy> you have to wait
[23:15:48] <sudden6> sxsa: do you use high fps and resolution?
[23:15:56] <sudden6> maybe bandwidth is not enough
[23:16:30] <sxsa> We are using 240p resolution
[23:17:03] <sudden6> then that's not the problem...
[23:17:53] <sudden6> best way to solve this then would probably be to create an issue on github with both logs
