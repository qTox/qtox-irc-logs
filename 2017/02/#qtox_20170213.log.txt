[20:07:52] <sudd3n6> zetok: Diadlo: abbat answered my mail and said he's not going to maintain any new qtox releases
[20:08:11] <zetok> I see
[20:08:21] *** sudd3n6 is now known as sudden6
[20:08:48] <sudden6> I think the best would be to fork his tox.pkg repo and continue from there
[20:08:58] <zetok> yep
[20:09:01] <sudden6> also we need a new maintainer :/
[20:10:57] <zetok> while at it, perhaps fork could be used to package not only qTox
[20:11:31] <zetok> since at least earlier also e.g. Toxic was being packaged on OBS
[20:11:51] <sudden6> zetok: but then it would be a good idea to ~coordinate with the tox.chat people
[20:12:21] <zetok> not really
[20:12:32] *** Quits: LittleVulpix (~Miranda@ ) (Quit: Miranda NG rocks. Trust the Vulpix. http://miranda-ng.org/)
[20:13:13] <sudden6> ok
[20:13:29] <sudden6> but duplicating all the packaging work isn't that good imo
[20:13:32] <zetok> s/tox.chat/toktok/
[20:13:37] <sudden6> ok
[20:14:01] <sudden6> anyway, first we have to find a maintainer^^
[20:17:19] <sudden6> zetok: about https://github.com/qTox/qTox-Website/pull/24 I think it can be merged, right?
[20:17:57] <zetok> uhm
[20:18:36] <zetok> it would be good to pull first translations from weblate, so that there would be no conflicts
[20:19:24] <sudden6> ok, I thought it wouldn't be that easy :)

[20:22:11] <zetok> no
[20:22:23] <sudden6> instructions? :/
[20:22:24] <zetok> `git fetch; git cherry-pick`
[20:22:59] <zetok> oh
[20:23:14] <zetok> right, before that I usually do `wlc commit && wlc lock`
[20:23:31] <sudden6> sorry, I don't really know how weblate works :/
[20:23:56] <sudden6> what's wlc?
[20:23:57] *** Quits: reBrain (~quassel@ ) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:24:21] <zetok> cli tool for managing repo(s) on weblate
[20:25:02] <zetok> i.e. instead of spending time on its web UI one can just quickly type a command
[20:25:25] <sudden6> can you pull the translations and I'll merge the stuff then?
[20:25:47] <zetok> ok

[20:35:37] <sudden6> yeah, it's the GH automatic name :)
[20:36:41] <sudden6> zetok: I'll write a draft for a blog post for a new maintainer
[20:36:52] <zetok> sounds good
[20:39:34] <zetok> sudden6: btw, regarding instructions, there is https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/MAINTAINING.md#translations-from-weblate , but the website only needs a simplified stuff from it
[20:40:10] <sudden6> ah, ok
[20:40:27] <zetok> in case of qTox translations, stuff pulled from weblate needs to be "cleaned up" by lupdate
[20:41:10] <zetok> as for website, usually `git merge --ff-only` is good enough
[20:41:48] <zetok> although sometimes I still cherry-pick stuff for website since there are some "translations" that aren't correct

[20:46:02] <Diadlo> Lol
[20:46:34] <sudden6> > 
[20:46:35] <sudden6> there is no way
[20:46:37] <sudden6> to compile qTox with original (iru) toxcore and I have no motivation to
[20:46:38] <sudden6> support another package which brings no new except breaking
