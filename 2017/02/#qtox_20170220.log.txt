[08:41:58] <georgios> good morning
[08:42:26] <georgios> is there a way to auto-login without having to authenticate?
[08:52:55] <nurupo> that should be possible if you don't password-protect your profile
[08:54:13] <nurupo> not sure if qtox implements auto login though
[08:56:03] <SkyzohKey> it could auto-login with password using gnome-keyring i guess
[08:56:08] <SkyzohKey> or some lib like that
[08:56:58] <nurupo> wouldn't that require you to input the keyring password every time you try to login instead?
[09:17:20] <georgios> it is a qt application and i have kwallet. i think i have gnome-keyring as well because some gnome application spawns a prompt asking for a password
[09:17:21] <zetok> nurupo: yes
[09:18:03] <zetok> georgios: https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3332
[09:18:05] <georgios> authenticating once per session is not a problem
[09:18:58] <georgios> but right now i have to auth 3 times! (mail-gnome-keyring,chromium-kwallet,qtox)
[09:20:51] *** Quits: VVD (~VVD@ ) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[09:20:58] <zetok> well, someone would need to make the code from PR that I've linked to work, then qTox could support using keychain
[09:21:13] *** Joins: VVD (~VVD@ )
[09:29:03] <georgios> for the moment i found out that deleting my password will give me the option to auto-login. what security implications does that have?
[09:31:22] *** Quits: VVD (~VVD@ ) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[09:31:49] <nurupo> the password is used to encrypt your profile file

[09:32:32] <nurupo> the file contains your permanent tox keypair: secret and public keys

[20:40:16] <diadlo> sudden6, zetok: Hi
[20:41:17] <diadlo> What do you think about K&R braces style + braces everywhere?
[20:41:20] <sudden6> diadlo: hi :)
[20:41:51] <diadlo> Also, sudden6, any progress with UML?
[20:42:15] <sudden6> diadlo: nope, didn't have time
[20:42:20] <sudden6> you?
[20:42:27] <diadlo> Me too :/
[20:43:15] <sudden6> about k&r brace style, I don't like it
[20:44:33] <diadlo> I don't like Allman style, but I use it because it's our standard
[20:45:00] <diadlo> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[20:45:02] <sudden6> yeah, the debate about coding style can be endless
[20:45:33] <diadlo> I'm agree, that better use K&R with braces everywhere or Allman without it
[20:46:25] <sudden6> you mean allman without braces for single line statements?
[20:46:30] <diadlo> +
[20:46:44] <sudden6> I can live with that
[20:46:57] <diadlo> But can't with K&R? :D

[20:47:22] <diadlo> Wht to say
