[16:55:43] <sudd3n6> I've sent an email
[16:57:47] <zetok> thanks
[17:08:32] <zetok> sudd3n6: btw, an example is in https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/4167
[17:08:59] <sudd3n6> didn't see that
[17:09:16] <sudd3n6> but I think it's good practise to include the example in the script directly
[17:09:33] <zetok> right

[19:39:26] <sudd3n6> Diadlo: can you upload your UML work somewhere? I want to toy with it maybe
[19:46:26] <Diadlo> I can send PR
[19:46:32] <Diadlo> Are you ok with it?
[19:46:45] <sudd3n6> you could just overwrite my stuff too
[19:46:58] <sudd3n6> since we're going with your way
[19:47:04] *** Quits: Yoshimo (~anything@ ) (Quit: Yoshimo)
[19:50:49] <Diadlo> Ок
[19:57:09] <Diadlo> sudd3n6: Done
[19:57:28] <sudd3n6> thx, will we work on this today?
[19:58:08] <Diadlo> I don't think, that I have enough strength
[19:58:23] <sudd3n6> ok, then I'll try some stuff
[19:58:38] <Diadlo> A bit tired and still didn't read article, that I share tonight
[19:58:54] <sudd3n6> no problem, get your sleep
[19:59:25] <Diadlo> Not time to sleep, I need to read some books :)
[20:00:02] <sudd3n6> interesting, science or fiction?^^
[20:01:33] <Diadlo> IDK. Seems, it's named "De Oratore" in english
[20:02:18] <Diadlo> I'm not sure about the genre
[20:02:26] <sudd3n6> looks latin not english to me^^
[20:03:04] <Diadlo> Seems English guys don't translate latin names
[20:03:29] <sudd3n6> mhm
[20:03:37] <Diadlo> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Oratore
[20:04:25] <Diadlo> Seems "On the Orator" is translation
[20:04:58] <sudd3n6> interesting, but not really my style of books
[20:05:28] <Diadlo> I'd never try this style. First experience
[20:05:59] <sudd3n6> then have fun reading :)
[20:06:04] <Diadlo> Thanks)
