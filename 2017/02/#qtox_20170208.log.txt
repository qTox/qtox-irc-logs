[12:48:22] <zetok> I guess
[12:48:47] <sudden6> mhmm, I also think so

[13:41:14] <Seppel> Hey
[13:41:19] <Seppel> I'm not sure if I should use Tox
[13:41:30] <Seppel> I've read on the internet that it is not as secure as we think
[13:41:45] <Seppel> because some 4chan things (I'm not excactly sure)
[13:41:50] <Seppel> what are your thoughts?
[13:43:46] <sudden6> Seppel: there's a known security weakness see https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/426 that affects you if your secret key get stolen
[13:43:51] <sudden6> which should not happen
[13:48:55] <Seppel> well it may be a stupid question but
[13:49:05] <Seppel> I thought your private key will not leave the computer?
[13:49:10] <Seppel> how can other people get it then?
[13:50:25] *** Joins: f10__ (~flo@ )
[13:51:03] <sudden6> Seppel: it should not, it can get stolen though
[13:51:19] <zetok> Seppel: easily
[13:51:35] <zetok> Seppel: using technology called pendrive
[13:55:08] <Seppel> zetok: so it looks like a ordinary usb device
[13:55:19] <Seppel> zetok: can that also happen if you use disk encryption?
[13:55:53] <sudden6> Seppel: everybody that can get the unencrypted *.tox file can do it
[13:56:09] <sudden6> may it be malware or tricking you
[13:56:15] <Seppel> sudden6: 
[13:56:30] <Seppel> sudden6: isn't it encrypted by default in like qtox or utox with a password?
[13:56:49] <sudden6> only with a password, which is not the default
[13:57:17] <Seppel> well I've read that it is still experimental. 
[13:57:30] <sudden6> Seppel: it is
[13:57:33] <Seppel> so I assume you do not recommend it for sensitive information?
[13:57:52] <sudden6> exactly, you're better of with proven things like PGP for that
[13:58:11] <sudden6> for home use, I would highly recommend it
[13:58:24] <Seppel> well PGP does not support IM. I do not trust mail services so that is not a good alternative I guess?
[13:58:43] <Seppel> looking for some secure IM possibilities. 
[13:58:56] <zetok> just use it
[14:02:23] <Seppel> I'm using qtox it shows ToxCore version 0.1.0
[14:02:37] <Seppel> on the Toxcore Github it shows 0.1.6 is available if I'm right
[14:02:45] <Seppel> seems like I'm using an old version

[23:39:26] <anoa> What do you guys use for automatic changelogs again?
[23:41:32] <nurupo> tux3: i see a signature file being linked for widnows downloads in https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/README.md
[23:41:55] <nurupo> but theinstaller file it links to gets rebuilt on every qtox commit https://build.tox.chat/view/qtox/job/qTox_pkg_windows_x86-64_stable_release/
[23:42:34] <tux3> nurupo, The stable job should only get triggered on new stable releases, I'll fix it
[23:43:08] <nurupo> i assume the signature file is static, so does it still work correctly despite the installer updating more frequently than the signature file is?
[23:43:20] <nurupo> tux3: oh, okay
[23:43:28] <tux3> Nope, I'll have to re-sign
[23:43:50] <tux3> The signature is normally updated at the same time the new releases are sent to the auto-update servers
[23:44:05] <nurupo> breaking news: tux3 is resigning from qtox! :P
[23:44:32] <tux3> Wat :) ?
[23:45:02] <nurupo> just a joke on ><tux3> Nope, I'll have to re-sign
