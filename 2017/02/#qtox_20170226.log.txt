[00:00:06] <Diadlo> This blocks is less part of code
[00:00:29] <Diadlo> So it can be fixed manually later
[00:03:56] <Diadlo> clang-format -i -style=file $(git ls-files | grep "\(\.h\|\.cpp\)")
[00:04:23] <zetok> why grep if glob does the job?
[00:04:39] <Diadlo> It doesn't for me
[00:04:55] <zetok> have you tried to escape it?
[00:05:08] <Diadlo> zsh
[00:05:14] <zetok> eh
[00:05:28] <zetok> dunno then
[00:05:48] <Diadlo> But if you will write script `#!/bin/bash` should solve the problem
[00:07:49] <Diadlo> http://pastebin.com/DfhT8qXe
[00:07:54] <Diadlo> It should be `clang-format off` too?
[00:10:28] <zetok> echo -e '#!'"/bin/bash\nclang-format -i -style=file \$(git ls-files *.cpp *.h)" > script
[00:10:30] <zetok> yeah
[00:10:47] <Diadlo> :/
[00:11:43] <Diadlo> Seems it doesn't enforce braces

[00:54:19] <SSBN-731> How long do you think these USB sticks will last? They're quite new, but if I unplug them and leave them somewhere, will they start to degrade without being written to?

[11:42:48] <Diadlo> Hi
[11:43:00] <Diadlo> What do you think about using `astyle` instead of `clang-format`? It support `add-brackets` option
[11:46:29] <zetok> clang-tidy also can do it
[11:46:41] <Diadlo> 2 tools VS 1 tool
[11:46:53] <Diadlo> But ok
[11:48:31] <zetok> we can try with astyle
[11:48:44] <Diadlo> Just if you want :)

[12:22:08] <zetok> it would be good to merge #4208 before other PRs get rebased, so that there would be no problems with travis builds

[12:24:51] <zetok> perhaps
[12:26:05] <zetok> hmm
