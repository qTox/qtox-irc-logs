[13:47:41] <zetok> sudden6: pong
[13:48:02] <sudden6> how can I get the list of contributors for this release?
[13:48:19] <sudden6> also we need a cat for this release
[13:49:07] <sudden6> and a random quote if there's a good one
[13:50:28] <zetok> sudden6: `git log --format='%an' v1.7.0..v1.8.0 | sort -fu`
[13:51:23] <sudden6> zetok: that doesn't work
[13:51:34] <zetok> do you have the tag?
[13:51:48] <sudden6> it tries to execute the names 
[13:52:00] <zetok> um
[13:52:01] <sudden6> ie Zetok command not found
[13:52:20] <zetok> $() = ``
[13:53:27] <sudden6> nope
[13:53:36] <sudden6> also doesn't work
[13:53:58] <zetok> just copypaste it without the backticks
[13:54:22] <sudden6> ah 
[13:54:25] <sudden6> sorry
[13:57:43] <sudden6> zetok: can you think of a random quote for the blog post?
[13:57:50] <zetok> nah
[13:57:57] <sudden6> then I'll leave it
[13:58:33] <sudden6> but I'm sure you can supply a good cat pic?

[13:59:46] <sudden6> I think the first one is good
[14:03:39] <sudden6> zetok: PR submitted please review and merge
[14:08:19] <zetok> sudden6: done; I wonder if the order of contributors should be random
[14:08:36] <sudden6> why?
[14:10:31] <zetok> looks more pleasant to the eye?

[14:32:36] <zetok> :|
[14:34:18] <zetok> sudden6: it doesn't add it to translations
[14:34:27] <zetok> sudden6: and translations need to be pulled from weblate
[14:35:11] <sudden6> I have no idea how to add it to the translations :/
[14:35:35] <zetok> the simple way is to use sed in a bash `for` loop
[14:35:49] <sudden6> "simple"
[14:38:04] <zetok> something like `for f in *.json; do sed -i '/some line/a\    "text": "",' $f`
[14:45:53] *** Quits: MDrights (~MDrights@ ) (Quit: MDrights)
[14:51:13] <Chiitoo> Speaking of translations... if there's is something that would change in all(?) the .ts and .qm files, would I be touching those at all?
[14:52:51] <Chiitoo> That said, they probably don't even have a translation, as it's only shown in the code.
[14:53:23] <sudden6> the .ts and .qm files are "automatically" generated from the code
[14:53:40] <Chiitoo> Okies, yeah, something I was suspecting.

[16:43:10] <Diadl0> Hello
[16:43:23] <Diadl0> sudden6, zetok: I merge tests?
[16:43:28] <Diadl0> (without docs now)
[16:43:48] <sudden6> Hi :)
[16:43:50] <sudden6> yes
[16:43:55] <sudden6> merge them :)
[16:44:13] <sudden6> also how about The Plan™?
[16:44:40] <Diadl0> It's one of The Plan step
[16:44:44] <Diadl0> Isn't it?
[16:44:48] <sudden6> (I should add a paragraph that it should only be refered to as "The Plan™" :D
[16:44:51] <zetok> Diadl0: testing is not optional?
[16:45:07] <sudden6> yeah, but you mentioned something about the diagrams
[16:45:12] <Diadl0> zetok: It should be :)
[16:45:13] <sudden6> have you had time for that?
[16:45:33] <Diadl0> 1) I start changing diagram
[16:45:46] <Diadl0> 2) But here is too many things to change
[16:45:52] <zetok> oh, right, one has to run `make check` for tests to run, right?
[16:46:00] <Diadl0> Yes
[16:46:21] <Diadl0> sudden6: Why do you move "sendMessage" to Friend?
[16:46:21] <zetok> then sure, go ahead
[16:46:23] <sudden6> so tests are built every time, but only run with make check
[16:46:48] <sudden6> because it's an action you do "on" the friend
[16:47:07] <Diadl0> It's wrong
[16:47:18] <sudden6> don't think so
[16:47:24] <Diadl0> Do you understand, why we remove widget from Friend?
[16:47:46] <sudden6> yes, because UI has nothing to do with the friend itself
[16:47:55] <Diadl0> Yes. Core too
[16:48:11] <sudden6> not in the way I imagined it
[16:48:17] <Diadl0> Friend should is a structure with signals
[16:48:33] <Diadl0> *without should
[16:49:05] <sudden6> ie, what do you need to send a message? Right, a Friend (or Group)
[16:49:21] <Diadl0> Otherwise you will have a spaghetti of dependency
[16:49:26] *** Quits: bennabiy (~bennabiy@ ) (Quit: http://www.yellowdeli.com)
[16:49:52] <sudden6> I don't think so, UI depends on Friend which depends on Core
[16:50:11] <Diadl0> Profile form wants to show friend info -> take core dependency
[16:50:13] *** Joins: f10 (~flo@ )
[16:50:18] <sudden6> no
[16:50:20] <Diadl0> Yees
[16:50:22] <Diadl0> Exectly
[16:50:31] <Diadl0> It's your vision
[16:50:31] <sudden6> Profile form only depends on Friend then
[16:50:42] <Diadl0> Friend depencs on Core
[16:51:00] <sudden6> yes, but Profileform doesn't need to know about that
[16:51:07] <Diadl0> "SendMessage"
[16:51:23] <Diadl0> I'm absolutely don't know it... yes
[16:51:47] <Diadl0> Profile form shouldn't has an ability to do it
[16:51:56] <sudden6> you mean because of "TOX_MESSAGE_TYPE?
[16:52:17] <Diadl0> No. Because of logic
[16:52:26] <Diadl0> Ok
[16:52:47] <Diadl0> Should the profile be able to send a message?
[16:52:56] <Diadl0> Friend profile form
[16:53:18] <sudden6> no, but it's included in Friends abilities
[16:53:27] <Diadl0> Yes. It's wrong
[16:53:37] <sudden6> just because Friend can send messages you don't have to do it
[16:54:10] <Diadl0> Why we use `const`?
[16:54:24] <Diadl0> We can simply do not modify it
[16:54:26] *** Joins: f10__ (~flo@ )
[16:54:38] <sudden6> because I didn't exactly know what it did when I drew the UML
[16:54:57] <sudden6> as I said it needs work in the details
[16:55:13] <Diadl0> No
[16:55:19] <Diadl0> I'm not about The Plan now
[16:55:24] <Diadl0> I'm about code at all
[16:55:47] <sudden6> why not use it?
[16:56:07] <sudden6> it's a feature of C++ that can prevent errors
[16:56:18] <Diadl0> Exactly
[16:56:20] <Diadl0> Same here
[16:56:43] <Diadl0> You shouldn't provide ability to do something, logically different
[16:57:20] <sudden6> I have a different view of this, let me explain
[16:57:38] <sudden6> You have a ToxFriend, what can you do with it?
[16:57:48] <Diadl0> In your vision?
[16:57:57] <sudden6> check if he's online -> getStatus()
[16:58:14] <sudden6> call him -> startCall(...)
[16:58:25] *** Joins: [0xAA] (~ThisIsZen@ )
[16:58:26] <Diadl0> It's not how OOP works
[16:58:27] <sudden6> send him a message -> sendMessage()
[16:58:35] <sudden6> that's exactly how OOP works
[16:58:42] <Diadl0> You simply can move all methods, thich have "Firned*" or "friendId" as first parameter
[16:58:51] <Diadl0> Do you think it's right?
[16:59:09] <sudden6> yep, because that's ~what I did :)
[16:59:14] <Diadl0> Lol?
[16:59:18] <Diadl0> Are you kidding me?
[16:59:34] <sudden6> no, I'm serious
[16:59:49] <Diadl0> I don't know what to say
[17:00:17] <sudden6> Maybe we have different thoughts about how OOP works? lol
[17:00:41] <sudden6> then, draw up your vision and show me^^
[17:00:55] <Diadl0> My vision not so different from current one
[17:01:17] <sudden6> yeah, but a picture is worth more than 1000 IRC lines ;)
[17:01:45] <sudden6> to save time, do it only for ToxCore, ToxFriend and ToxCall
[17:03:09] <sudden6> also with pictures it's easier to ask others for help on this

[20:40:09] <Diadl0> Hello
[20:40:11] <Diadl0> In cpp file :)
[20:41:19] <Diadl0> On the top
[20:46:20] <agrecascino> everything should be fixed now
[20:46:27] <Diadl0> Ok
[21:12:05] <sudden6> Diadl0: I've yet to see your alternative suggestion
[21:12:50] <sudden6> IMO having a the function sendMessage or whatever belong to the Model is correct
[21:13:38] <agrecascino> sudden6, thanks for helping me learn not to rely on change symbol name under cursor
[21:13:48] <sudden6> > The view model is an abstraction of the view exposing public properties and commands
[21:14:02] <sudden6> sendMessage is a command
[21:14:24] <sudden6> and it belongs to ToxFriend
[21:14:29] <Diadl0> Do whatever you whant
[21:15:02] <sudden6> agrecascino: yeah, it's best to try compiling before pushing ^^
[21:16:18] <sudden6> Diadl0: so you're now ok with it?
[21:16:58] <agrecascino> is it me or are travis ci builds taking ages
[21:17:17] <sudden6> their macos infrastructure is always overloaded
[21:17:22] <Diadl0> I don't know how describe it to you. Let's try and after some time I will say: "I told yourself"
[21:17:47] <sudden6> Then draw a f***** diagram, it'll explain everything
[21:18:14] <Diadl0> Build diagram from current source code
[21:18:34] <Diadl0> *Only Core part
[21:19:37] *** Joins: reBrain (~quassel@ )
[21:20:08] <Diadl0> In this diagram shouldn't be `Friend`
[21:23:30] <Diadl0> Core can give Friend as parameter
[21:24:02] <Diadl0> Friend is a simplest structure
[21:24:17] <Diadl0> Core -- service
[21:24:41] <sudden6> so you want to do it like c-toxcore does it?
[21:25:15] <sudden6> where all functions have as first parameter a "this" parameter specifying the struct they operate on?
[21:26:18] <Diadl0> Yes
[21:26:45] <sudden6> and you want only Core to have all the functions?
[21:26:54] <sudden6> and only Core to emit all the signals?
[21:26:59] <Diadl0> No
[21:27:09] <Diadl0> Here is difference
[21:27:11] <Diadl0> Can be
[21:27:40] <Diadl0> We can create FriendChat
[21:27:49] <Diadl0> Is a service, which store friend
[21:27:54] <Diadl0> And have sendMessage
[21:27:55] <Diadl0> call
[21:27:57] <Diadl0> etc.
[21:29:34] <sudden6> what would the benefit of this be?
[21:30:14] <Diadl0> Some class can give the access to the simple `Friend` structure, without chat logic
[21:30:42] <Diadl0> Why we don't store all information and methods in one big class?
[21:30:49] <Diadl0> We split it on small parts
[21:31:32] <sudden6> That's exactly what I'm trying to achieve "split it into independent parts"
[21:31:43] <Diadl0> Too big parts
[21:32:06] <Diadl0> Your `ToxFriend` is `FriendChat`
[21:32:19] <Diadl0> It have `Chat` interface
[21:32:21] <Diadl0> *has
[21:32:39] <sudden6> The only drawback I see with my approach is, that somehow ToxFriend needs to be able to call into ToxCore for sending messages, for example
[21:32:57] <sudden6> I tried to model it like libtoxcore does it
[21:34:31] <Diadl0> Your `ToxFriend` depend of Core
[21:34:55] <Diadl0> Do you agree?
[21:35:03] <sudden6> Yes
[21:35:24] <Diadl0> Does FriendWidget should depend of Core?
[21:35:31] <sudden6> no
[21:35:35] <Diadl0> *on
[21:35:50] <Diadl0> In your model it depend
[21:36:12] <sudden6> In my model it would depend on ToxFriend
[21:36:27] <Diadl0> You are forget about transitivity?
[21:36:58] <sudden6> I don't know that word, link?
[21:37:08] <Diadl0> A => B => C
[21:37:09] <Diadl0> A => C
[21:37:35] <sudden6> ok, it depends on Core through ToxFriend got it
[21:37:35] <Diadl0> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation
[21:38:05] <sudden6> but I don't see why that's a bad thing and how your approach solves this
[21:38:07] <Diadl0> Why FriendWidget should depend of Core?
[21:38:26] <Diadl0> In my model FriendWidget has Friend
[21:38:53] <Diadl0> Friend independent on Core
[21:39:23] <Diadl0> Core =(depend)=> Friend  |   FriendWidget =(depend)=> Friend
[21:39:31] <Diadl0> FriendWidget (not depend) Core
[21:40:06] <sudden6> ok, so you're "Inverting" the structure a bit
[21:40:44] <Diadl0> Yes. But it change the root of idea
[21:40:54] <sudden6> question then, how would I send message then?
[21:40:56] <agrecascino> did someone say object diagram
[21:40:56] <agrecascino> https://a.pomf.cat/tychbi.png
[21:41:12] <agrecascino> i say object DIEAGRAM
[21:41:15] <Diadl0> friendChat.sendMessage()
[21:41:36] <Diadl0> Friend* f;  FriendChat friendChat(f, core);
[21:41:39] <Diadl0> Something like this
[21:41:41] <sudden6> agrecascino: pf, UML is all the hottest stuff now ;;)
[21:41:51] <sudden6> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qTox/planning/master/Core-Classdiagram.png
[21:42:02] <agrecascino> does UML have nuclear functions
[21:42:06] <agrecascino> i thought not
[21:42:35] <sudden6> Diadl0: I see
[21:43:39] <sudden6> so would, FriendChat call directly into the library then?
[21:43:46] <sudden6> (c-toxcore)
[21:43:59] <Diadl0> Maybe. It's another question
[21:44:08] <sudden6> or would Core expose all that
[21:44:12] *** Quits: reBrain (~quassel@ ) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:44:38] <Diadl0> I think, it can be part of core module => call c-toxcore function directly
[21:44:50] <Diadl0> BUT
[21:44:59] <Diadl0> FriendChat depend on History
[21:45:10] <Diadl0> It's not good
[21:45:18] <sudden6> can't we introduce that one level higher?
[21:45:26] <Diadl0> I.e. not good, that core depend on History
[21:45:30] <sudden6> and call it ToxChat
[21:45:42] <sudden6> so that it would be responsible for groups and friends?
[21:45:55] <sudden6> btw, you convinced me, your approach is better
[21:46:12] <sudden6> you just have to get better at explaining ;)
[21:46:40] <agrecascino> explain it using gimp and explosions
[21:46:43] <Diadl0> Hooray)
[21:46:44] <Diadl0> It's a bit hard on not native language
[21:46:58] <sudden6> -> use f******* pictures
[21:47:09] <zetok> sudden6: pls
[21:47:10] <agrecascino> 3 minutes of battery left
[21:47:44] <sudden6> sorry, I was getting a bit frustrated^^
[21:48:08] <agrecascino> see you guys later
[21:48:13] <sudden6> see you
[21:48:18] <Diadl0> Bye
[21:48:57] <agrecascino> powertop stopped reporting charge
[21:50:18] <sudden6> doing this refactoring will be hard work
[21:50:38] <Diadl0> https://i.imgur.com/JwxWf0X.png
[21:50:45] <Diadl0> 4 minutes
[21:50:59] <Diadl0> Instead of 
[21:51:02] <Diadl0> [00:39] <Diadl0> Core =(depend)=> Friend  |   FriendWidget =(depend)=> Friend
[21:51:03] <Diadl0> [00:39] <Diadl0> FriendWidget (not depend) Core
[21:51:09] <sudden6> shouldn't the arrows be the other direction
[21:51:18] <Diadl0> :/
[21:51:21] <Diadl0> +4 min
[21:51:46] <sudden6> Diadl0: you forgot, the 15min conversation we had before...

[21:53:55] <Diadl0> You are right: `ToxChat + History ~ FriendChat` is a good idea

[21:56:06] <sudden6> like this?
[21:56:11] <sudden6> 5min ;)
[21:56:24] <Diadl0> Exectly!
[21:56:33] <Diadl0> Thanks :)
[21:56:56] <Diadl0> Maybe it's not the best design. But it's my vision
[21:57:51] <Diadl0> I can't draw, because I haven't this image in my mind
[21:57:53] <sudden6> the problem I see is, how do we handle removal of a friend?
[21:59:00] <sudden6> also, drawing gets easier after a while, when I did the first few versions of the UML stuff it was horrible, but now it's pretty easy :)
[22:00:01] <Diadl0> I draw only 1 UML. "You have not enough diagram"
[22:00:14] <sudden6> I have quite the opposite problem, when you tell me something with words, I can't imagine it and not see it's beauty or failures
[22:00:35] <Diadl0> 1) We can add to friend "bool removed". Seems, most horrible solution
[22:00:42] <sudden6> +1
[22:01:00] <Diadl0> 2) We can do it like it's implemented now. I.e. store not friend, but friendId
[22:01:07] <sudden6> can we return Friend as const shared_ptr ?
[22:01:48] <Diadl0> Yes. But when you remove it somewhere, shared_ptr still available
[22:02:09] <sudden6> I want to avoid using friendId, that's not how an high-level API should work
[22:02:38] <sudden6> exactly, but ToxFriend would for example emit a signal that it's invalid now
[22:02:59] <Diadl0> Hm
[22:03:09] <Diadl0> 1) Too many signals
[22:03:09] <sudden6> this way it would be thread safe and null pointer dereference safe
[22:03:12] <Diadl0> But I have an idea
[22:03:32] <Diadl0> ToxChat will validate incoming Friend
[22:03:45] <Diadl0> And just ignore removed
[22:03:51] <Diadl0> What do you think?
[22:04:15] <sudden6> 1) what happens, if the friend gets invalidated after ToxChat is constructed?
[22:04:31] <sudden6> 2) with a signal, ToxChat could just reemit it
[22:05:14] <Diadl0> I talk not about construction, but about every method call
[22:05:59] <Diadl0> No one know, when signal will come to slot
[22:06:03] <sudden6> hmm, don't really now, signals sound more elegant to me
[22:06:14] <sudden6> yes
[22:06:35] <Diadl0> AFAIK, Qt does not guarantee, that it will come at all
[22:06:52] <sudden6> that would be pretty bad
[22:07:00] <Diadl0> Yep
[22:07:51] <Diadl0> Mutex?
[22:08:09] <sudden6> get's complicated soon
[22:08:32] <sudden6> I'm still looking for a doc about signal delivery guarantee
[22:08:49] <sudden6> I can't believe that signals won't get deliverd
[22:10:00] <Diadl0> 1:100000 chance. Qt randomly drop signal ;)
[22:10:27] <sudden6> sounds like a bug or a very bad implementation
[22:10:35] <Diadl0> It was a joke
[22:10:45] <sudden6> -_- sorry^^
[22:11:05] <Diadl0> But AFAIK docs really don't guarantee delivery
[22:11:55] <Diadl0> Not enough process time for this thread
[22:11:58] <Diadl0> For exmaple
[22:12:23] <sudden6> then it will be delivered the next event loop iteration
[22:12:42] <Diadl0> Lol. You never get freeze?
[22:13:08] <sudden6> ?
[22:13:11] <Diadl0> Application / Windows manager / OS
[22:13:39] <sudden6> yeah, but how ist that qts fault or responsibility?
[22:14:11] <Diadl0> I never said, that it's Qt's fault
[22:15:15] <Diadl0> Nevermind. I just think, that signal can let us down
[22:16:01] <Diadl0> emit signal + delete | Friend using | receive signal
[22:16:05] <Diadl0> ------time line-------------->
[22:16:45] <sudden6> ok but that can also happen for the invalid flag, imagine you have ToxChat check for a valid Friend and the ToxCore thread invalidates it after the check
[22:16:53] <Diadl0> Mutex
[22:17:57] <Diadl0> Need to think
[22:18:03] <sudden6> yep, me too
[22:18:08] <Diadl0> Good night
[22:18:16] <sudden6> can you update the UML with the stuff?
[22:18:21] <sudden6> good night :)
[22:18:34] <Diadl0> Someday :)
[22:18:39] <Diadl0> But without methods
[22:18:59] <sudden6> just the general structure will already be helpful :)
[22:19:31] <Diadl0> Here is problem: you are draw UML. And after this discussion we should rewrite it
[22:19:55] <sudden6> I uploaded the source, modifying it is pretty easy :)
[22:20:04] <Diadl0> Hoho
[22:20:18] <sudden6> Don't try to import it from the code, that's a huge mess
