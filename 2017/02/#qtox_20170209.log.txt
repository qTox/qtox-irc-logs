[14:46:12] <dan300> Hello. I have a problem. I read that qTox v1.8.0 is available but I don't receive new versions in my Debian 8 and I still use version 1.6.0. I check the repos but I think are OK. What can be the problem? Thanks.
[14:49:17] <zetok> well, the repo maintainer no longer maintains it
[14:50:05] <zetok> we're looking for someone willing to maintain it
[14:51:50] <dan300> But in another distros updates are available?
[14:52:35] *** Joins: sudden6 (~anonymous@ )
[14:52:51] <zetok> yeah, distros that have ~proper packaging usually have up-to-date qTox
[14:55:44] <zetok> with that being said, it's interesting to see that e.g. nixos which seems to have proper packaging not only has only very outdated qTox version, but it's also horribly packaged

[15:03:54] <dan300> OK. Thanks zetok. I don't have the knowledge for maintain Debian repos but if I learn someday I could do it.
[15:04:08] <zetok> sounds good :)
[15:04:24] <zetok> btw, the best way to learn is to just try and do it :)
[15:14:23] <dan300> I only know at moment a few commands for use at terminal. I study computers and I hope with time can learn a lot.
[15:18:36] <sudden6> zetok: we have to spin a 1.8.3 release :/
[15:18:47] <zetok> s/3/2/
[15:18:51] <zetok> sudden6: what's up?
[15:19:02] <sudden6> decryption is broken
[15:19:19] <zetok> on 1.8.0 ?
[15:20:04] <zetok> IIRC the reported issue happened on something after 1.8.0
[15:21:04] <sudden6> hmm, I didn't look that close
[15:21:44] <zetok> I'll check with 1.8.1 in a moment
[15:22:51] <sudden6> zetok: I think you're right, 1.8 doesn't use toxencrypt yet, phew
