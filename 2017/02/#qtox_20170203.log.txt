[02:38:44] <nurupo> not sure if i reported on it or not, but i bumped ffmpeg on jenkins from 3.1.3 to 3.2.2 the other day
[02:39:22] <nurupo> 3.2.x includes the fix that we applied on top of 3.1.3 (zetok should remember that one)
[02:39:49] <nurupo> (this fix https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3612 https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commit/18ce63a60e1bffc35b4df5d8a4f9a1ff1a96cb9a)

[02:53:46] <nurupo> no
[03:07:16] <Emcy_> hm

[16:38:07] <grin> zetok, thanks. it's a surprise nobody was complaining loudly about it so far
[16:38:20] <sudden6> hi zetok :)
[16:43:39] <zetok> sudden6: hello
[16:44:11] <zetok> sudden6: do you have time to review & possibly merge PRs that are ready for 1.8 ?
[16:44:17] <sudden6> sorry about my lack of communication the last days, was very busy with another project
[16:44:24] <sudden6> zetok: yeah
[16:44:30] * zetok just looked at gh
[16:44:45] <sudden6> anything happened that I should now about? :)
[16:45:19] <sudden6> also where do all the new contributors come from? I looked at GH and there are new names everywhere :D
[16:46:02] <zetok> the internet :D
[16:46:38] <grin> oh sorry for the last 2 issues then
[16:46:44] <grin> I'm not even here ;)
[16:46:53] <grin> btw I come from the tox public chat
[16:47:19] <grin> where Mr. Unicode Name got bored with me and sent to the he^H^channel
[16:48:56] <grin> and the chain was antox->toxic->uTox->qTox [in the direction from not working to working]
[16:49:11] * zetok wonders
[16:49:14] <sudden6> nice to hear qTox is on the working end^^
[16:49:21] <grin> it seems to be
[16:49:40] <grin> full of problems, but magnitudes less than the others :-)
[16:50:05] <grin> toxic is nice but pretty limited, and I didn't even mention non-working ones like that python thingy
[16:50:21] <grin> toxygen yeah
[16:50:34] <grin> not up to the task yet
[16:51:15] <Chiitoo> sudden6: I think I just remembered why I ended up with 'left' and 'right'.  It made more sense due to the fact that the same buttons are used for 'Open File' and other things that are not just 'accept' and 'decline/cancel'...  Did you think of that?
[16:51:32] * grin secretly missing internal statistics about traffix and network and dht and stuff
[16:52:16] <sudden6> Chiitoo: yes, I thought that's probably the case, but IMO left/right is worse, because it gives absolutely no idea what the click events are supposed to do
[16:52:49] <sudden6> and if we decide to move the buttons, we would have to reorder them again
[16:52:54] <Chiitoo> Hmmm.
[16:53:17] <sudden6> Chiitoo: maybe you can find better names than accept/decline that include all use cases for the buttons
[16:53:54] <Chiitoo> Mmmh.

[17:19:02] <sudden6> zetok: what do you think about https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/4126
[17:21:13] <zetok> sudden6: not sure about the README.md, but there's no reason to not link to it from community builds section in INSTALL.md
[17:21:55] <sudden6> ok
[17:30:06] <sudden6> zetok: I'm not sure how to answer to the PR
[17:31:05] <sudden6> the guy proposing the PR seems to be directly from the repository team, so I think he can be counted as reliable
[17:31:43] <sudden6> and they only seem to download the binaries from tox.chat
[17:33:26] <zetok> depends on how paranoid you are
[17:34:14] <sudden6> depends on how paranoid we are ;)
[17:34:41] <zetok> not really
[17:36:16] <zetok> sudden6: "Ok, that sounds like something that should be added to the community builds section in INSTALL.md" ?
[17:36:28] <zetok> sudden6: how does that sound as an answer?
[17:37:27] <sudden6> zetok: good, I think :)
[17:37:32] <sudden6> thx
[17:37:34] <zetok> sudden6: technically, the binaries section in README.md isn't as "paranoid" as it should be, since that would hurt the project
[17:38:01] <sudden6> yeah, I'm actually more worried about reliability anyway
[17:38:04] <zetok> same goes for "community builds" section in INSTALL.md, to even greater degree
[17:38:43] <sudden6> the things we list as the recommended sources should get regular updates
[17:39:30] <zetok> mm
[17:39:40] <zetok> there's a slight problem with linux repos
[17:40:29] <zetok> I haven't talked to abbat yet, but he seems to have lost interest in maintaining stuff after toktok migration
[17:42:08] <zetok> then again, it's not like anyone actually has bothered to even make a PR to the tox.pkg repo to bump qTox version to 1.7
[17:42:51] <zetok> someone should make a PR
[17:42:52] <sudden6> yep
[17:43:38] <sudden6> last time I talked to him, he didn't want to maintain two versions of toxcore, maybe now that everyone is on toktok he might move everything to it
[17:44:10] <zetok> um, there's no need to maintain 2 versions though?
[17:45:02] <sudden6> maybe he didn't know that
[17:45:16] <zetok> um
[17:45:31] <sudden6> or he didn't trust toktok to stay alive, IDK
[17:46:13] <zetok> or that both trees would remain alive
[17:46:28] <zetok> which would be problematic

[18:11:22] <sudden6> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/4128 proposal-accepted?
[18:13:19] <zetok> #4128 – yeah, but there should be an option to turn it off, as some people don't like that
[18:13:32] <sudden6> agreed
[18:14:08] <zetok> >I changed stuff for 1.8 are you ok with it?
[18:14:09] <zetok> sure
[18:14:34] <zetok> regarding initramfs, I don't know
[18:15:36] <sudden6> mhm, I'd really like to start merging his coding style PR
[18:15:52] <zetok> a couple of weeks ago initramfs wrote that he'd continue working on the clang format stuff
[18:16:05] <sudden6> define "a couple of weeks ago"
[18:16:21] <zetok> >2
[18:17:02] <zetok> :|
[18:17:07] <sudden6> that's an eternity in internet time...
[18:17:13] <zetok> right
[18:17:27] <zetok> if there's stuff missing in the PR/changes needed, a new PR probably should be opened
[18:17:28] <sudden6> idk if we should start to consider him MIA or something
[18:17:36] <zetok> ~yeah
[18:17:51] <zetok> not MIA, just busy
[18:18:08] <zetok> (not that it changes much)
[18:18:12] <sudden6> yeah, could also be
[18:18:43] <sudden6> maybe we should send an email to him to query for an update?
[18:18:59] <sudden6> anything agains merging #4115
[18:19:02] <sudden6> ?
[18:19:21] <zetok> dunno, didn't test

[18:20:47] <zetok> coding style ;)
[18:21:21] * sudden6 wonders how that got into the coding style
[18:22:43] <sudden6> hmm, qtcreator seems to have that in the config, interesting
[18:31:34] <zetok> um?
[18:32:16] <zetok> #4115 is missing spaces between `if`s and parentheses
