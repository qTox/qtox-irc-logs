[01:26:21] <Dako300> All of the sudden I can't compile qTox and I don't know why
[01:26:35] <Dako300> I'll post the output in a pastebin
[01:27:17] <Dako300> while it is compiling, it says it can't find a lot of libraries like -ltoxcrypto, -ltoxgroup and others
[01:28:54] <Dako300>  First question: are toxcrypto, toxnetwork, toxdht toxnetcrypto, toxfriends, toxmessenger and toxgroup supposed to be built libraries?

[14:35:41] <sudden6> Diadlo: which is better #4146 or #4138?
[14:36:59] <sudden6> I prefer 4138 for now, becaues it doesn't need widget
[14:51:36] <agrecascino> i wiil fight for the right to maps!
[14:51:53] <sudden6> agrecascino: ?!?
[14:52:52] <agrecascino> the only differences between my pr and his is that his doesn't mess with widget and uses vectors
[14:53:09] <agrecascino> and i've been using maps a lot lately
[14:53:42] <sudden6> yeah, maps are not the problem in this case, but going over widget is a bad idea

[17:29:05] <Diadlo> 2) Why do you call `CoreAV::groupNameListChanged` from widget, instead of `Core::onGroupNamelistChange`?

[17:43:38] <agrecascino> Diadlo, ?
[17:43:40] <agrecascino> the second thing is a spelling mistake
[17:43:44] <agrecascino> the first was because i'm pretty sure the guy was trolling me with the pr
[17:43:47] <agrecascino> oh wait
[17:43:49] <agrecascino> nvm
[17:43:51] <agrecascino> sorry i get what you meant now
[17:43:53] <agrecascino> so
[17:44:51] <agrecascino> i created that function to remove a peer from a groupcall, since i don't think either of those can access groupcalls from coreav
[17:44:51] <Diadlo> His PR appear first. How he can trolling you?)
[17:45:04] <agrecascino> okay
[17:45:14] <agrecascino> so we talked about it in #qtox for about an hour
[17:45:26] <agrecascino> and right before we were going to make our pr
[17:45:28] <Diadlo> Ok
[17:45:30] <agrecascino> he creates his
[17:45:35] <Diadlo> I didn't know it
[17:45:40] <agrecascino> with a sock account '007-agent'
[17:46:02] <agrecascino> the account had been created like only a little before the commit
[17:46:32] <agrecascino> that commit was also originally included with #4139
[17:47:26] <agrecascino> is Core a friend class of CoreAV?
[17:47:28] *** Quits: sandrorso (~sandro@ ) (Quit: Ciao. Sto andando via)
[17:47:32] <agrecascino> or something like that?
[17:47:43] <Diadlo> Core contains CoreAv instance
[17:48:14] <agrecascino> but i assume i can't access the groupcalls variable inside it?
[17:48:18] <agrecascino> since it's private
[17:48:34] <Diadlo> Nope. I mean, you can call your function
[17:48:37] <Diadlo> Like in widget
[17:48:47] <Diadlo> But not from widget :)
[17:48:58] <agrecascino> so move the call into core?
[17:49:33] <Diadlo> Ask yourself: does it really matter to widget?
[17:49:48] <Diadlo> Updateing core namelist
[17:50:45] <Diadlo> Widget::onGroupNamelistChange connected with Core::groupNamelistChanged
[17:50:58] <Diadlo> *conversely
[17:51:06] <Diadlo> I.e. it start from core
[17:51:12] <Diadlo> Why it should come to widget?
[17:52:21] <Diadlo> I hope you understand what I mean?)
[17:52:30] <agrecascino> yes, the call is misplaced
[17:53:12] <agrecascino> is calling it from Core::onGroupNameListChange okay?
[17:53:40] <Diadlo> I this so
[17:53:45] <Diadlo> *think
[17:54:08] <agrecascino> a simple if and call should be fine?
[17:54:26] <agrecascino> like
[17:54:35] <agrecascino> i know these functions block
[17:54:41] <Diadlo> If you need `if` use it :)
[17:57:10] <agrecascino> actually there was pretty big bug in there i just noticed
[17:57:27] <Diadlo> ?
[17:57:33] <agrecascino> in the widget call
[17:57:49] <agrecascino> i call it on TOX_CONFERENCE_STATE_CHANGE_PEER_JOIN
[17:57:54] <agrecascino> instead of EXIT
[17:58:22] <Diadlo> :)
[18:01:19] <agrecascino> sometimes git hurts me inside

[19:55:49] <sudden6> but we could check our IRC logs
[19:55:51] <Diadlo> I will select best

[19:56:07] <sudden6> I'll leave those two to you then :)
[19:56:18] <Diadlo> But agrecascino PR looks better now
[19:56:21] <Diadlo> For me
[19:56:50] <sudden6> also, when will we remove qmake support?
[19:57:11] <sudden6> IIRC it was to be removed in 1.9
[19:57:21] <Diadlo> IIRC too
[19:57:47] <sudden6> are you going to do it?
[19:58:15] <Diadlo> I think it will be done in the last week
[19:58:33] <sudden6> I think we should do it soon

[23:46:28] <Dako300> Dialdo: reading the chat history. The #4138 (the openal stuff from agrecascino) was originally written in my fork of qTox (to handle the bitrate). I had to collapse the git history to fit the contribution requirement of just sone commit, but the code existed there before the fork was created (but I can't prove it because of timestamps and a lack of separate commits)
[23:47:03] <Dako300> oh darn, he isn't even here
