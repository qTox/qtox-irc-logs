[08:37:42] <diadlo> Hi
[08:38:43] <diadlo> A found a ~mistake: run cmake from non qTox dir => you will have an error `osx directory not found`
[08:39:23] <diadlo> Because cmake/Installation.cmake call update-version script, which try to `cd osx`
[08:39:54] <zetok> right

[21:17:48] <zetok> Diadlo: pong
[21:19:13] <Diadlo> Do you prefer K&R braces style?
[21:19:47] <oranges> yes
[21:20:05] <Diadlo> oranges: Hm?
[21:20:19] <oranges> yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
[21:20:24] <Diadlo> -_-
[21:21:16] <zetok> Diadlo: ~yep
[21:22:05] <Diadlo> What do you think about change the brace style?
[21:23:38] *** Joins: noavarice (5f20424f@ )
[21:25:42] <zetok> dunno, sudden6 might get upset about that
[21:27:50] <Diadlo> Current style upset me :/
[21:28:03] <noavarice> me too - http://pastebin.com/R6sBP5Hc
[21:29:06] <Chiitoo> I guess my favourite is Allman.  That is, braces always lined up.
[21:30:56] <zetok> Chiitoo: um, what about the stuff noavarice just linked to?
[21:31:33] <Chiitoo> Yeah, that looks like what I'm thinking of.
[21:31:51] <zetok> um
[21:31:57] <Diadlo> Lol?)
[21:32:17] <zetok> the only thing that it makes me think of is "yeah, no, time to change the style"
[21:32:43] <noavarice> Chiitoo: what does actually this alignment gain for you?
[21:32:52] <Chiitoo> Feels easiest to read to me.
[21:33:21] <Diadlo> zetok: AFAIR clang generate patch to fix style
[21:33:35] <zetok> it does?
[21:33:44] <Diadlo> Hm..
[21:33:53] <zetok> I was planning to just use `find src/ -iname '*.cpp' -o -iname '*.h' -exec clang-format -i -style=file {} +`
[21:33:54] <noavarice> Chiitoo: there's already a spacing and closing bracket
[21:34:07] <Diadlo> Which script used by toktok?
[21:35:03] *** Joins: f10 (~flo@ )
[21:35:13] <Chiitoo> Only thing I'm talking about, is where the braces are.  Not sure the example code there requires that many of them.  :D
[21:36:00] <zetok> current style requires them
[21:36:02] <noavarice> Chiitoo: It's about code convention, all this brackets
[21:36:51] <Chiitoo> Mhm.
[21:41:28] <Diadlo> Also, because we have two ways: allman without one line if block VS K&R with braces everywhere => I think `braces everywhere` is a good rule
[21:42:03] <Diadlo> It can help to avoid mistakes with writing code with indentation and without braces
[21:48:27] <noavarice> that's all? we're done?)
[21:49:12] <zetok> :s
[21:49:46] <zetok> K&R with braces everywhere requires custom style
[21:54:07] <zetok> or maybe not :/
[21:54:47] *** Quits: noavarice (5f20424f@ ) (Quit: Page closed)
[21:55:36] <zetok> ok, nvm, clang-format cannot into that stuff
[21:57:21] *** Quits: Emcy_ (~MC@ ) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[22:02:51] <Diadlo> clang-format can't K&R?
[22:03:20] <Diadlo> Or can't require braces for every if statement?
[22:03:34] <zetok> can't require braces
[22:03:40] <Diadlo> Lol
[22:04:32] <Diadlo> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26111162/can-clang-format-add-braces-to-single-line-if-statements-etc#28437960
[22:07:13] <zetok> `enum Foo {` or `enum Bar\n{` ?
[22:09:30] <Diadlo> AFAIK, the second one. Like with functions
[22:09:52] <Chiitoo> If I were to decide, { under e, but so far I'm doing so little code yet that my opinion shouldn't matter that much.  :D
[22:09:55] <Diadlo> Not that important
[22:10:16] <zetok> um
[22:17:13] <Diadlo> I think we should discuss about it with sudden6
[22:17:26] <Diadlo> Maybe tomorrow
[22:21:07] <Diadlo> Good night
