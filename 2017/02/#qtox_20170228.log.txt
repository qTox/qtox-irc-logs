[19:36:32] <sudden6> zetok: Diadlo hi o/
[19:36:48] <sudden6> any ideas why travis suddenly decided to break?
[19:38:16] <zetok> hello
[19:38:21] <zetok> travis does that sometimes
[19:38:54] <sudden6> I guess they decided to change something we use
[19:43:35] <Chiitoo> I'm sure it happened just to delay the buttons a bit more.  :]
[19:47:23] <sudden6> yeah, probably^^
[19:47:53] <sudden6> zetok: would it be wise to disable the not working test on osx until we have a fix?
[19:50:38] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] sudden6 opened pull request #4218: fix(qmake): add forgotten files to qTox.pro (master...fix_qmake_bild) https://git.io/vyYfl

[19:53:48] <zetok> :/
[19:54:16] <zetok> osx travis is crap, but it does find things that don't work

[20:07:04] <sudden6> hmm, travis is currently not loading old logs, so I can't even compare build logs :/
[20:07:23] <Chiitoo> Thought that was just me (not getting them logs).
[20:18:14] <sudden6> no, it's a travis error because of a S3 error^^
