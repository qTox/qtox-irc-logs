[09:48:48] <Chiitoo> Would changing the UI (buttons) be considered a 'feat'?  Also, if said change lives under 'chatlog', would that be the appropriate scope?
[09:57:04] <zetok> `feat(UI)`
[09:57:08] <zetok> Chiitoo: â†‘
[09:57:50] <Chiitoo> Okies.
[09:58:38] <Chiitoo> Does a referenced issue have to be '#0000', or can it be the full URL?
[09:59:04] <zetok> ##
[09:59:17] <zetok> full URL is not as flexible
[09:59:45] <Chiitoo> Okay.  I just prefer them due to 'git log', where just the number isn't as helpful.  :]
[10:01:42] <Chiitoo> Heh.  Didn't know/remember there are two duplicates for the filetransferwidget buttons.  Wasn't sure it would be that wanted/accepted, but I guess it might be!
[10:11:53] <Chiitoo> And indeed, it might be happening, only a little over a year later!
[10:12:27] <Chiitoo> Took me the whole day, or at least evening yesterday to figure out one tiny part of the change, which may or may not be an issue.  Others will no doubt be able to tell.

[14:21:32] <Chiitoo> Yay Windows build works too.  Been a while since I did one, so changes were required there as well.  Helps to not forget some of the required-for-static build stuff, I noticed.  >.<
