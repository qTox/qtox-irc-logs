[00:10:51] <oranges> I'm of the opinion that if your pr needs more than one commit to contain each logical change
[00:10:55] <oranges> you're not doing pr's correctly
[00:10:59] <oranges> since each pr should be atmoic as well

[00:21:12] <iphy> oranges: almost
[00:21:18] <iphy> oranges: I agree, but there are exceptions
[00:21:28] <iphy> oranges: in toktok, PRs are usually one commit
[00:21:44] <iphy> but these rules do have exceptions
[00:22:17] <nurupo> zetok: just got on irc
[00:23:10] <nurupo> zetok: you can also ping oranges and tux3 for build.tox.chat

[00:23:32] <oranges> no you cant
[00:23:36] <oranges> don't ping me for anything
[00:24:44] <zetok> :c
[00:24:51] <nurupo> me, oranges and tux3 have root on the machine and admin on jenkins web ui
[00:28:02] <nurupo> just letting nsa know so they know who to abduct :P

[11:03:53] <iphy> cisc: for osx
[11:03:53] <iphy> cisc: I'm very slowly contributing back my changes to upstream

[11:15:57] <cisc> thx, will get back to you with results
[11:24:28] <koshii> Has anyone tested qtox in China?
[11:24:31] <koshii> (Does it work?)
[11:24:52] <zetok> zero-ghost: ↑ ?
[11:25:34] <zetok> koshii: most likely
[11:25:38] <zero-ghost> yea
[11:25:54] <zero-ghost> person i had on it i think tested it with and without VPN
[11:25:55] <zero-ghost> and it worked
[11:32:47] <iphy> [10:28:27.528 UTC] widget/translator.cpp:74 : Debug: Error loading translation "ar"
[11:32:53] <iphy> (I removed "ar" from the translations)
[11:33:13] <iphy> why does it insist that I'm arabic?
[11:49:13] *** Quits: pcre (~quassel@ ) (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
[11:49:44] <zetok> :|
[11:50:48] <zetok> the idea was that qTox should try to detect on the first start the system language & use it
[11:51:09] <zetok> for me that never seemed to work under Linux
[11:51:17] <iphy> This is osx
[11:54:25] <zetok> or maybe it did "work"
[11:55:25] <zetok> (given that my $LANG and $LC_MESSAGES differ)
[11:57:49] <zetok> if it completely doesn't work on osx, it might be just trying to load first translation from the list, which would be ar
[12:02:33] <iphy> oh wow
[12:02:44] <iphy> you have two hard-coded lists of languages
[12:02:46] <iphy> I didn't realise that
[12:04:22] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/wiki/Translating#if-youre-adding-new-translations :|
[12:06:50] <iphy> cool
[12:07:01] <iphy> so 3 then
[12:07:20] <iphy> or 4, if you include the language names
