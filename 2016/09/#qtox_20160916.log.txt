[02:34:20] <majora> hello, I'm trying to build qtox via simple_make.sh and I'm getting QMAKESPEC has not been set, so configuration cannot be deduced.
[02:36:12] *** Quits: jjuran (~jjuran@ ) (Quit: jjuran)
[02:39:59] <oranges> have you tried setting QMAKESPEC ?
[02:40:04] <oranges> I'm sorry I don't know I"m a fraud ;~;
[02:41:38] <majora> idk what it should be set to q.q
[02:49:29] <zetok> majora: what OS?
[02:51:15] <majora> ubuntu 1404 q.q
[02:52:17] <zetok> majora: you could use packages
[02:52:38] <zetok> if you want to compile qTox, get some better distro
[02:52:38] <majora> how would I go about that?
[02:52:46] <majora> ok q.q
[02:52:47] <zetok> majora: https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Aantonbatenev%3Atox&package=qtox
[02:53:01] <zetok> it's in README.md
[02:53:23] <zetok> also, INSTALL.md lists compiling instructions for various distros

[03:12:10] *** Joins: dardevelin (~dardeveli@ )
