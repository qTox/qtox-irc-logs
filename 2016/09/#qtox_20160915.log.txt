[19:27:05] <sudden6> Diadlo: o/
[19:30:18] <sudden6> zetok: when do you think is the time to switch qtox from irungentoo toxcore to to toktok toxcore?
[19:30:44] <zetok> when it'll be guaranteed that it's a good idea
[19:31:35] *** Quits: jjuran (~jjuran@ ) (Quit: jjuran)
[19:31:38] <sudden6> I think it's already a good idea, but it isn't api-stable yet
[19:32:22] <sudden6> I'm not trying to switch now, just gathering opinions
[19:33:20] <zetok> >I think it's already a good idea
[19:33:22] <zetok> not yet
[19:33:39] <sudden6> why not?
[19:33:48] <Diadlo> sudden6: \o
[19:34:15] <zetok> no stable API, and no guarantees of any kind regarding API
[19:34:52] <zetok> aside from that, it most likely will create more work on the client side to keep up with things
[19:34:56] <sudden6> yep, no stable API is the dealbreaker for me atm, the rest is already better than irungentoo-toxcore
[19:35:03] <zetok> also, switch would create a packaging problem
[19:35:41] <sudden6> Diadlo: is there a reason not to merge https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3711
[19:35:59] <Diadlo> Nope
[19:36:04] <sudden6> hmm, didn't think of that
[19:36:12] <Diadlo> Why?
[19:36:27] <Diadlo> Oh.. Sorry
[19:36:33] <sudden6> I was waiting for you to merge, but I think you are waiting for me to merge :D
[19:36:44] <Diadlo> sudden6: Yep
[19:36:48] <Diadlo> I will merge it
[19:36:55] <sudden6> ok
[19:37:23] <sudden6> zetok: I just want to start thinking about it know, because it will happen sooner or later
[19:37:35] <sudden6> and I want to prepare a plan
[19:38:02] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] Diadlo pushed 2 new commits to master: https://git.io/viKII
[19:38:02] -qtox-git-spam- qTox/master 6f0431a Diadlo: fix(settings): Use old settings instead of default values...
[19:38:02] -qtox-git-spam- qTox/master 5a133b3 Diadlo: Merge pull request #3711...
[19:38:32] <sudden6> also packaging problem could be avoided by incrementing toxcore version and switching
[19:39:54] <zetok> :s
[19:43:32] *** Quits: initramfs (~initramfs@ ) (Quit: Leaving)
[19:54:51] <zetok> sudden6: what sort of plan?
[19:55:10] <zetok> Diadlo: is merge commit really needed?
[19:55:38] <sudden6> a list of issues that will need to be solved before switch
[19:56:33] <Diadlo> Hm... It's provide yeasy way to found PR. Is't it?
[19:57:26] <zetok> merge commit is needed ~only to keep things gpg-signed
[19:57:40] <Diadlo> Ok
[19:58:48] <zetok> if commits are already gpg-signed by a maintainer and can be fast-forwarded there's no need to make a merge commit
[20:03:14] <zetok> as for fast-forwarding, slightly modified script from iphy would do: https://gist.github.com/zetok/1da909a57fdbc7579aca4095f554fd49
[20:17:13] <sudden6> Diadlo: also found https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3713 
[20:17:35] <Diadlo> lgtm for you?
[20:17:40] <sudden6> should we agree on merging LGTMed PRs after no action for 1-2 days?
[20:17:51] <sudden6> I didn't test it, but code is ok
[20:18:48] <Diadlo> > should we agree on merging LGTMed PRs after no action for 1-2 days? <- Agree
[20:19:01] <sudden6> Diadlo: If you are waiting for an additional LGTM, it may be good to mention that in the comments^^
[20:19:22] <sudden6> so either 1 or 2 days? zetok any opinion?
[20:19:25] <Diadlo> Ok
[20:19:34] <Diadlo> sudden6: For small PRs
[20:19:58] <sudden6> mhm
[20:20:32] <sudden6> I think 2 days is better, accounts for different timezones
[20:21:01] <zetok> ~better
[20:21:47] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3685 ?
[20:22:35] <sudden6> zetok: I don't have windows to test this...
[20:22:50] <Diadlo> +1 ^
[20:22:55] <zetok> :|
[20:23:57] <zetok> ok, so it ~depends on https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3716
[20:24:17] <sudden6> probably
[20:24:37] <sudden6> I haven't looked into windows building in a looong time
[20:24:46] <sudden6> and I don't really want to
[20:24:53] <sudden6> I'm scared

[20:36:48] <zetok> um?

[20:37:07] <zetok> sec, need to look again

[20:40:58] <sudden6> good :)
[20:41:08] <sudden6> I really like that feature
[20:41:22] <zetok> is it ready for testing?
