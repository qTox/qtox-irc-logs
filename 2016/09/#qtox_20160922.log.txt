[02:35:13] <nurupo> ><initramfs> clang-format cannot check include style or oder <-- it can sort #includes
[02:35:47] <nurupo> as iphy said, just run clang-format on all code on Travis and check that no git diff was generated by that
[02:39:43] <nurupo> ><initramfs> Qt seems to have a module called Qt Multimedia <-- I tried using Qt Multimedia that for video capture in 2013 with Qt 5.something and it was very broken. maybe something has changed since then
[02:42:22] <nurupo> initramfs: that's why qtox uses the poorely documented ffmpeg and that's also why we had this google summer of code project https://github.com/abibas/webcamCaptureNewDesign
[02:45:15] <nurupo> ><initramfs> At least the sound API from that looks good <-- don't know anything about sound in Qt
[02:46:43] <nurupo> openal-soft is cross-platform enough and is not that bad http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html . are there some issues with openal in qtox?
[02:48:21] <nurupo> >backends: ALSA, OSS, DirectSound, PulseAudio, MMDevAPI, CoreAudio, Solaris, QSA, SoundIO, OpenSL, WinMM, PortAudio, "Null" Output, and a .wav writer are currently implemented.
[03:41:25] *** Quits: Chiitoo (~Chiitoo@ ) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[03:56:15] <initramfs> nurupo: Sorry, if I was not clear, clang-format will stop sorting includes if the group of includes are not continuous (e.g. newlines between includes or having a extern "C" block)
[03:58:25] <initramfs> nurupo: Regarding audio, it's not so much that OpenAL-Soft has an issue but rather the usage of it within qTox. Besides, there are other libraries that suite our needs better (OpenAL-soft seems to bundle a bunch of stuff we don't need)
[04:00:26] <nurupo> yeah, openal-soft is more gae-oriented. it provides 3d sound and low-level audio functionality
[04:00:48] <nurupo> portaudio looks more high level
[04:01:01] <nurupo> 3d sound could be useful for groupchat a/v though :P
[04:04:14] <zetok> >are there some issues with openal in qtox?
[04:04:31] <zetok> nurupo: yep, it's the reason why filter_audio wouldn't work
[04:05:10] <nurupo> why?
[04:05:29] <zetok> openal doesn't provide data that filter_audio requires to work properly
[04:06:17] <zetok> IIRC irungentoo made a patch for openal with this long time ago, but it never was upstreamed, so.
[04:09:00] <nurupo> zetok: based on the disussion in this issue thread, openal might be providing all the required data https://github.com/irungentoo/filter_audio/pull/36
[04:09:36] <zetok> that's not what I was told
[04:10:15] <nurupo> when were you told this?
[04:10:38] <nurupo> because before that issue thread mannol didn't know openal-soft provided such functionality
[04:11:28] <zetok> mannol said that, and IIRC that was after those posts on gh
[04:13:58] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3524
[04:18:54] <nurupo> don't see mannol i nthat pr
[04:19:56] <zetok> no, but there are other reasons aside from filter_audio why openal is not good enough
[04:20:13] <zetok> and the PR kind mentions them
[04:20:52] <initramfs> It's not that it's "not good enough" it's more like we don't need all the functionality from OpenAL. The audio code can be simplified with a higher level library that handles less
[04:21:23] <Emcy> i want to say openal 3d audio works great
[04:21:59] <nurupo> zetok: i don't see the openning post in the PR mention any issues, it just references to #3625, #3626, which sound like issues on qTox side
[04:22:02] <Emcy> i play doom with it
[04:23:19] <initramfs> Emcy: I'm sure it does... But until the day comes that accurate stereoscopic 3D sound effects are required by qTox, it's a bit of an overkill.
[04:23:37] <zetok> nurupo: AFAIK antis81 said that those issues aren't fixable with openal
[04:24:04] <Emcy> just sayin
[04:24:20] <zetok> nurupo: someone did try to fix them, and now initramfs needs to keep audio settings tab open in order to have audio during the call
[04:24:39] <nurupo> hm, that's quite surprising. okay then.
[04:25:08] <initramfs> Which might I add, is quite annoying because video calls are useless now (unless I go and toggle multi-window mode every time)
[04:25:24] <initramfs> And it's not just me, my friends are affected as well
[04:25:30] <zetok> initramfs: um, detach just the friend window?
[04:25:41] <initramfs> Yes
[04:25:42] <initramfs> I know
[04:25:48] <initramfs> But I like the interface together
[04:25:56] <zetok> mm :(
[04:25:57] <initramfs> So I end up detaching it just for one call
[04:26:30] <initramfs> Detaching/Reattaching the window also screws up the splitter position (between chat window and call)
[04:27:01] <initramfs> s/call/friends list/
[04:28:28] <initramfs> antis81's working with a RtAudio reimplementation, and I'll try to help as much as I can with that, though I have some doubts over whether RtAudio is a viable choice for qTox
[04:28:54] <initramfs> So I'll prepare another implementation in PortAudio, if mine turns out to be redundant, it's all good.
[04:29:47] <zetok> portaudio?
[04:30:08] <initramfs> http://www.portaudio.com/ <- Similar to RtAudio
[04:30:39] <zetok> >and Unix (OSS/ALSA)
[04:30:42] <zetok> oh, yeah, no
[04:30:53] <zetok> that ain't gonna fly
[04:31:13] <initramfs> Wha?
[04:31:17] <zetok> on the other hand, RtAudio does support PA
[04:31:53] <initramfs> Oh, I read somewhere that PortAudio does support PA somehow
[04:32:01] <initramfs> I'll investigate before I do anything
[04:32:10] <zetok> it doesn't
[04:32:16] <zetok> at least the version that is packaged
[04:32:25] <Emcy> you could try and get openal fixes upstreamed
[04:32:38] <Emcy> the dev is a nice guy
[04:32:43] <zetok> and if it does and they can't even keep their main website right, that tells something
[04:37:41] *** Quits: cisc (~cisc@ ) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[04:39:02] <initramfs> Well, the reason I think RtAudio has issues include stuff like: header location is different in different distros, uses C++ exceptions which qTox somewhat refuses to use, support for various audio backends are assigned compile time
[04:39:56] <initramfs> The last point raises the main issue as RtAudio only exists in the AUR for Arch Linux users and by default the PKGCONFIG doesn't compile in support for PA
[04:41:09] <initramfs> I don't know if antis81 found a solution yet, but he also mentioned, trying to open a device that is already opened by another application causes RtAudio to throw an exception, which since qTox doesn't handle, crashes the applicaiton
[04:44:37] <zetok> so it's all shit :(

[10:21:57] <genesis> initramfs : PA in portaudio is very basic and not fine
[10:22:18] <genesis> you can't pass PA option for example
[10:22:24] *** Joins: f10_ (~flo@ )
[10:22:41] <genesis> you can't duck, you can't add echo filter etc.
[10:22:42] <initramfs> What kinda of options would one need to pass?
[10:23:17] <genesis> don't remember well the stuff, but it's quite unusable for rt thing like tox.
[10:23:30] <genesis> it's just compatibility stuff for games
[10:25:31] <genesis> audio stuff should be the main focus on qtox i think
[10:27:31] <initramfs> Also, where are you getting this information from? PA isn't even in PortAudio yet
[10:31:02] <genesis> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/wiki/Pulseaudio
[10:31:43] <Se7en> So
[10:31:56] <Se7en> Why has utox implemented the new toktok but qtox hasn't?
[10:31:56] <genesis> my mistake i think about openal
[10:32:14] <Se7en> I wanted to switch over to uTox for those reasons but it's broken as all fuck
[10:34:40] <iphy> Se7en: diadlo will be working on it for qtox
[10:35:09] <Se7en> Alright
[10:35:15] <Se7en> Anyone know why utox is broken?
[10:35:22] <Se7en> Their channel is empty so I can't ask them
[10:35:25] <iphy> grayhatter would know
[10:35:36] <iphy> he's in #toktok
