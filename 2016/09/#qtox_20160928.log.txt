[07:51:45] <cisc> is there any known issue for qtox lowering the output volume each time a call is connected down to 0? because I'm trying qtox on Leap 42.2 Beta 2 and that is what's happening
[07:53:34] <cisc> Commit hash: f05b7e040a073c7afadaf763dda5beaf130c6dbd
[08:06:52] *** Joins: albel727 (~albel727@ )
[08:08:09] <cisc> if I drag the slider for output volume up to 100%, as soon as I leave the Audio/Video tab and then go back into it it's back down to 0
[08:21:45] <zetok> cisc: have you tried searching?
[08:28:02] <cisc> zetok: not yet, but didn't think there would be anything there since i'm testing on Leap 42.2 Beta 2
[08:28:21] <cisc> and same OBS package doesn't exhibit same issue on Troubleweed
[08:29:40] <zetok> huh
[08:29:51] <zetok> that's interesting
[08:29:59] <cisc> could be this one or similar https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3478
[08:30:10] <cisc> except it sets to min. when going out of the tab, immediately
[08:30:53] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3538 https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3721 ?
[08:33:25] <cisc> it's not 3538 b/c no audio even when in tab, and not 3721 b/c I tested it multiple times and each time the output volume when going out of the tab drops down to 0
[08:39:46] <nurupo> zetok: i got an email of someone complaining of an unspecified tox client crashing in video settings on windows 10
[08:40:06] <nurupo> just curious, was the stable qTox updated to use the patched ffmpeg?
[08:40:21] <zetok> dunno
[08:44:22] <nurupo> the stable qtox on jenkins was last built before the ffmpeg was patched
[08:46:09] <nurupo> if we assume tux3 uses the jenkins binary for windows releases, then it has the crashy ffmpeg
[08:47:04] <nurupo> might make sense to push a patch, based on the same commit but with updated ffmpeg
[08:47:25] <nurupo> could also use the updated openssl, since they patched something a week ago
[08:48:09] <nurupo> tux3: ^
[08:48:33] <nurupo> tux3: here is the patched ffmpeg issue i'm talking about https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3612

[19:36:57] <cisc> installed qtox from the OBS repo both on SuSE Tumbleweed & Leap 42.2 Beta. Output volume does not work at all on the 42.2 Beta but fine on Tumbleweed, so something isn't playing nice
