[15:39:48] <zetok> initramfs: ↑ LGTM ?
[15:40:58] <initramfs> Well given I don't know any of those languages, I'll just lgtm given it's from weblate
[15:41:32] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] Talkless opened pull request #3702: fix(widget): do not block logout on Linux desktop environments v2 (master...fix-linux-logout-v2) https://git.io/viRFn
[15:43:38] <zetok> initramfs: thanks :)
[15:43:58] <initramfs> zetok: Went starting a new translation, should we start directly on weblate or add a translation file directly as a PR to qTox
[15:44:19] <initramfs> Me and a few friends are planning to translate to traditional chinese
[15:44:29] <zetok> ooh, nice
[15:45:26] <zetok> weblate makes things easier for people who aren't interested in "technical stuff"
[15:45:54] <initramfs> Sure
[15:46:26] <zetok> so, in other words, it's slightly easer/less time consuming for maintainers to merge a translation PR with everything in it ready
[15:46:57] <zetok> i.e. when I pull new translations from weblate, I need to manually add it to places in qTox
[15:47:35] <zetok> initramfs: https://github.com/qTox/qTox/wiki/Translating#if-youre-adding-new-translations ← if you're still interested in making a PR ;)
[15:47:45] <initramfs> Okay
[15:47:53] <initramfs> When pulling a non-weblate translation PR, does it get added to weblate?
[15:48:01] <zetok> ~yep
[15:48:04] <initramfs> Okay
[15:48:10] <zetok> weblate merges stuff from master
[15:48:14] <initramfs> Okay
[15:48:19] <initramfs> I'll make a PR eventually then, save you some trouble
[15:48:40] <initramfs> Since you seem to be the only one who's actually pulling in updates.
[15:48:44] <zetok> (except for when I push newest translations, since I amend commits from weblate)
[15:48:59] <initramfs> I see
[15:49:28] <zetok> in case of pushing newest translations I just manually reset weblate to current master, and freeze weblate translations for time of merging PR
[15:49:50] <initramfs> Seems like a hassle
[15:49:59] <zetok> not much
[15:50:09] <initramfs> Ehh okay.
[15:50:42] <zetok> `git cherry-pick -e commit` and I have vim macro that does the commit renaming for me, and rest is mostly scripted
[15:50:55] <initramfs> Ah
[15:51:00] <initramfs> Zetok and his scripts
[15:51:25] <initramfs> I would not be surprised if you have a script for making coffee
[15:51:41] <zetok> ;D
[15:52:01] <zetok> not that far yet, but part of the process is "scripted"
[15:52:33] <zetok> although I'm not sure if I'd trust technology with brewing my coffee
[15:52:34] <initramfs> Not bad
[15:53:23] <initramfs> Anyways, need to go now. Last week or so has been hectic, just moved from Taiwan to Canada (thus my limited availability). I'll be more available once everything settles down
[15:53:42] <zetok> I see
[15:53:46] *** 17SAA36P6 is now known as jjuran
[15:53:48] <zetok> cya later :)
[15:53:56] <initramfs> Bye
