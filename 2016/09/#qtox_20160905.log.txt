[02:35:57] <C0rn3j___> What is the recommended setup if I want to chat with friends through multiple devices?

[02:36:32] <C0rn3j___> I've managed to import a profile in Antox from qTox, but logging in to both at once makes it fight each other.
[02:41:18] <C0rn3j___> zetok: Also no worries, I have 25 char random password on my tox profile file. If it's using something like AES encryption I should be fine ^^

[21:13:04] <sudden6> zetok: another chore, updating the bootstrap node list
[21:13:14] <zetok> yeah
[21:13:14] <sudden6> do we have a script for that?
[21:13:22] <zetok> 2 programs actually
[21:14:03] <sudden6> what would be the process to do that?

[21:16:07] <sudden6> wouldn't it be better to use nodes.tox.chat?

[21:16:32] <zetok> ~no
[21:16:41] <sudden6> why?
[21:16:43] <zetok> especially when this didn't even exist
[21:17:07] <sudden6> ok so it's only because it didn't exist?
[21:17:14] <zetok> ~yep
[21:17:26] <sudden6> your ~ is making me nervous
[21:17:57] <zetok> I just don't see much point in changing something that already works in this case :)
[21:18:19] <sudden6> ok, maybe I'll get my hands dirty on some Rust and extend it ;)
[21:18:39] <zetok> sounds good :)
[21:21:24] <zetok> hmm
[21:21:29] <zetok> now that I think about it
[21:22:50] <zetok> sudden6: it's been some time since it was compiled, and since Rust libs ecosystem can move sometimes at quite a peace some it might fail to compile initially, and updating deps could make it worse – if there'll be any problems please say so
[21:23:39] <sudden6> mhm, I'll not do this today anyway, going to bed early :)
[21:25:40] <zetok> ok

[22:33:09] <Diadlo> Anybody know, does this is fixed? https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/issues/1128
[22:35:25] <Diadlo> Or why it's closed?
[22:36:52] <zetok> right
[22:37:33] <zetok> so, grupchat numbers aren't unchanging, even during same run
[22:37:39] <zetok> toxcore reuses them
[22:38:04] <zetok> IIRC qTox at the time didn't really account for that
[22:38:39] <zetok> IIRC dubslow wanted the numbers to not change
[22:38:55] <zetok> oh, no, wait
[22:39:00] <zetok> it's about peer numbers
[22:39:04] <zetok> same story though :D
[22:39:29] <zetok> (and no, this isn't going to change AFAIK)
[22:39:37] <zetok> (in toxcore, that is)
[22:41:27] <zetok> so if you have peers (name:number in gc): A:1, B:2, C:3, once B leaves, there are A:1 and C:2, once B rejoins there are A:1, C:2, B:3
[22:41:47] <zetok> the only reliable way of tracking who is who is to use PKs of peers in the groupchat
[22:42:16] <zetok> (for current groupchats, dunno how's the situation for new grupchats but I doubt whether that changes)
[22:44:47] <Diadlo> zetok: Ok. Thanks for detailed explanation :)
[22:45:39] <zetok> np :)
[22:45:44] <Diadlo> Why we can't restructure peer-id pairs on somebody leave?
[22:46:17] <zetok> um
[22:46:30] <zetok> making those pairs in the first place is wrong
[22:47:39] * zetok sighs
[22:47:45] <Diadlo> What is "first place"?
[22:48:26] <zetok> "to begin with", "to start with"
[22:48:48] <Diadlo> Ok
[22:49:22] <zetok> um, I don't know what qTox actually does
[22:49:58] <oranges> it's a client for the tox p2p communication protocol
[22:50:02] <Chiitoo> I think it sends messages, and stuff.
[22:50:04] <zetok> as for restructuring pairs every time a peer joins/leaves most likely would crash horribly in case of $something, or be a performance bottleneck
[22:50:06] <Chiitoo> Aff late.
[22:50:16] <zetok> no wai
[22:50:59] <Diadlo> zetok: You're right
[22:51:10] <zetok> Diadlo: not to mention those wonderful scenarios where by the time that you've finished restructuring pairs peer already has left :D
