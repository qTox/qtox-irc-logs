[18:31:51] <sudden6> hi everybody
[18:32:32] <sudden6> zetok: https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3717 you say mostly fixed, could you post the test case text where it's not fixed?
[18:34:13] <zetok> sudden6: I did
[18:34:45] <sudden6> I meant in text form, for copy paste
[18:34:53] <zetok> oh
[18:35:01] <zetok> just prepend the test case with `>`
[18:35:06] <zetok> (from the issue)
[18:35:15] <sudden6> ah, thx
[18:36:34] <iphy> how's the clang-format effort going?
[18:36:41] <zetok> oh
[18:36:48] <zetok> initramfs was on it
[18:37:33] <sudden6> iphy: is your question from yesterday still relevant?
[18:37:47] <iphy> which one?
[18:37:51] <iphy> sudden6: oh
[18:37:53] <iphy> no, it's not
[18:38:36] <sudden6> ok
[18:42:31] <sudden6> zetok: I can now fully reproduce, but for me the text appears as soon as I move the cursor inside the chat area
[18:42:41] <zetok> right
[18:43:35] <zetok> IIRC it did sometimes work like that for me
[18:46:19] <sudden6> yeah, I posted the instructions for Diadlo to reproduce, maybe it's even a different issue
[19:00:26] *** Quits: glasscapt (~glasscapt@ ) (Read error: Connection timed out)
[19:02:29] <iphy> zetok: what's the rule for #includes?
[19:03:04] <iphy> some use "src/....h" and some are without the src/
[19:03:36] <zetok> um, there's no rule for that AFAIK
[19:03:55] <iphy> there are advantages to both, but using both at the same time gives you no advantages of either
[19:05:15] <iphy> so what do you want the rule to be?
[19:05:20] <iphy> and how do you plan to enforce it?
[19:05:43] <iphy> the latter is more easily enforceable
[19:05:50] <sudden6> what are the advantages of both?
[19:06:00] <iphy> sudden6: ^ that's one :)
[19:06:10] <sudden6> also iphy, are you good with crypto?
[19:06:36] <iphy> sudden6: I'm not good with anything
[19:07:02] <sudden6> could you still take a look at my comment in https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3583 ? If I made an obvious mistake?
[19:07:17] <sudden6> also I think TokTok speaks otherwise ;)
[19:07:47] <iphy> sudden6: how much of that ticket do I need to read to understand your comment?
[19:08:10] <Diadlo> iphy: Hello
[19:08:12] <Diadlo> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3678#issuecomment-244185158
[19:08:28] <sudden6> nothing basically, we currently use a static salt to encrypt the history db, my comment is about removing that static salt by replacing it with the public toxid
[19:08:54] <sudden6> I'm unsure if this introduces any obvious security issue
[19:08:54] <zetok> sudden6: that improves it
[19:09:17] <Diadlo> iphy: About include
[19:09:36] <Diadlo> I have one local branch where I remove all "src/" from includes
[19:09:42] <zetok> sudden6: it's just that instead of having one common salt for all people using qTox you have a known salt for people who have friends
[19:09:59] <sudden6> yep, that's a drawback
[19:10:03] <sudden6> but still better
[19:10:08] <zetok> yeah
[19:10:12] * sudden6 goes to add this to the list
[19:10:14] <iphy> Diadlo: ok, and you use relative paths instead?
[19:11:17] <iphy> wait, so qtox used a single salt for every user globally?
[19:11:42] <sudden6> zetok: wait, it's not an issue
[19:11:55] <Diadlo> iphy: In real, no
[19:12:10] <iphy> ok, anyway I don't care
[19:12:10] <sudden6> because if you have one salt per user it's equivalent to a bruteforce attack
[19:12:19] <zetok> iphy: since the migration to the sqlcipher
[19:12:23] <iphy> Diadlo: what about the #includes?
[19:12:36] <iphy> did you change everything to relative paths?
[19:12:49] <sudden6> iphy: you mentioned an advantage to paths without src
[19:12:54] <sudden6> what is it?
[19:12:58] <Diadlo> If file to include in the same directory -- use relative. If not -- relative to src/
[19:13:06] <iphy> Diadlo: uh
[19:13:19] <iphy> ok.. that changes nothing
[19:13:44] <iphy> it just removes some bytes from the source code with no change otherwise
[19:14:06] <Diadlo> What problem with #include ?
[19:14:32] <iphy> sudden6: it depends on what kind of rules you want to enforce
[19:15:03] <sudden6> is it only a cosmetic difference or also a functional one?
[19:15:07] <iphy> for example, if you want local headers to be enclosed in "" instead of <>, then having relative paths helps, because you don't need a -Isrc flag
[19:15:47] <iphy> forcing local headers to be in "" makes it easier for formatters to group headers in blocks
[19:16:07] <iphy> e.g. module > project > system
[19:16:29] <Diadlo> iphy: We try to follow the rule about "" and <>
[19:16:46] <Diadlo> Local includes with "" others with <>
[19:16:48] <iphy> Diadlo: yeah, but the compiler won't be able to enforce it if you have "-Isrc"
[19:16:59] <sudden6> I also prefer "" local <> others
[19:17:42] <iphy> it's easy to visually distinguish what headers are inside the current subsystem, and what is including a different subsystem
[19:18:08] <iphy> and source code formatters can use that information to make groups
[19:19:04] <iphy> of course, qtox is a huge mess with every subsystem somehow transitively including every other subsystem, with basically the whole codebase forming one huge cycle with lots of smaller sub-cycles
[19:19:35] <iphy> but assuming that someday that won't be the case, you'll benefit from additional clarity and enforceable syntax guidelines
[19:21:19] <iphy> and today you'd benefit from knowing what parts of the code are reaching deeply into different subsystems
[19:22:10] <zetok> so, `src/` ?
[19:23:03] * zetok sighs
[19:23:17] <zetok> can someone open a PR to the CONTRIBUTING.md with the change?
[19:23:35] <zetok> I'd do it, but I have no idea what the change is supposed to be
[19:24:18] <sudden6> will do
[19:24:23] <zetok> thanks :)
[19:34:59] <iphy> zetok: adding src/ to everything ensures that you won't be able to enforce the "" rule, and will prevent formatters from detecting groups as described
[19:36:01] <iphy> At least enforcing it would become a bit more difficult and will need to be a separate validation step
[19:42:50] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] sudden6 opened pull request #3729: docs(CONTRIBUTING): add section about include styles (master...include_style) https://git.io/viSNK
[19:44:00] <iphy> sudden6: so how would you enforce this policy?
[19:51:22] <sudden6> I don't know, maybe when someone will implement clang-format or astyle support for qTox?
[19:51:45] <sudden6> iphy: is this even what you meant?
[19:53:52] <iphy> no
[19:54:09] *** Quits: f10 (~flo@ ) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:54:35] <iphy> sudden6: remove -I$TOP_SRCDIR (or whatever)
[19:54:51] <iphy> that'll enforce what I meant
[19:56:06] <sudden6> ok, then please leave a comment on gh what you actually mean
[19:56:18] <sudden6> atm I'm not sure what you meant
[20:01:31] <iphy> sudden6: I don't know whether this discussion is worth having
[20:02:03] <iphy> you won't be able to enforce that rule for generated headers
[20:02:07] <iphy> like ui_*.h
[20:02:35] <iphy> it's easy to enforce "local headers must start with src/ and be in quotation marks"
[20:02:46] <iphy> your rule set is hard to enforce
[20:08:10] *** Joins: f10 (~flo@ )
[20:09:58] <iphy> sudden6: src/net/toxme.cpp:22
[20:10:21] <iphy> I would recommend you don't fix it
[20:12:00] <iphy> instead, write a grep expression that checks the format
[20:12:21] <iphy> put it in a test, let the test fail and show you all the instances of that violation, and clean them up
[20:14:28] <iphy> find src -name "*.cpp" -or -name "*.h" -exec grep '#include "' {} \; | grep -v '#include "src/' # rule 1
[20:14:52] <iphy> find src -name "*.cpp" -or -name "*.h" -exec grep '#include <src/' {} \; # rule 2
[20:15:05] <iphy> turns out toxme.cpp was the only violation
[20:16:20] <iphy> ! find src -name "*.cpp" -or -name "*.h" | xargs grep '#include <src/'
[20:16:50] <iphy> if you put this line somewhere in a script, it will fail because of toxme.cpp:22
[20:18:32] <sudden6> iphy: so the rules are the ones you described?
[20:20:24] <sudden6> can you give an example of an include according to your rules and one counterexample?
[20:20:45] <sudden6> I didn't want to make my own rules, I just tried to translate what you were writing in IRC
[20:32:20] <iphy> https://gist.github.com/iphydf/0febaec22660fd86ea984e498b25747d
[20:32:39] <iphy> sudden6: this passes the two rules I made validations for
[20:35:55] <iphy> sudden6: it's the opposite of the rules I discussed earlier
[20:36:06] <iphy> Both have advantages and disadvantages
[20:36:07] <iphy> Like I said
[20:36:13] <sudden6> ok, so your idea is to make all paths relative to the repository root
[20:36:41] <iphy> This patch changes the code to the rule that is closest to what you have now
[20:37:15] <iphy> Changing it to the rule I mentioned before would be a larger diff
[20:38:25] <sudden6> zetok Diadlo are you ok with "src/path/to/locla" and <System/Include.h> ?
[20:38:31] <iphy> So, these are now all not relative
[20:38:57] <iphy> They are absolute if you consider the source root the root
[20:38:57] <zetok> sudden6: um, it doesn't really matter to me; I just like consistency
[20:39:15] <iphy> All relative would mean lots of ../
[20:39:19] <Diadlo> sudden6: Yes. But sometimes qt creator use <> style for auto include :/
[20:39:38] <sudden6> yeah, me to, I just got confused because iphy first described something else than he is now...
[20:40:01] <sudden6> eh, so is "localinclude.h" not relative?
[20:40:10] <sudden6> (like it's now)
[20:40:33] <iphy> sudden6: I'm describing two ways
[20:40:33] <iphy> You currently have about 3 different ways
[20:40:33] <iphy> Mixing styles makes it hard to enforce one
[20:40:41] *** Quits: albel727 (~albel727@ ) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[20:40:42] <iphy> Yes that's relative
[20:41:09] <sudden6> iphy yeah, but you first started with one style and then talked about the other one
[20:41:14] <Diadlo> sudden6: It would be nice to know the opinion antis81
[20:41:25] <iphy> Right, that was not very clear, sorry
[20:41:34] <sudden6> Diadlo: right
[20:41:51] <sudden6> also initramfs maybe,
[20:41:57] <Diadlo> Yep
[20:42:13] *** Joins: albel727 (~albel727@ )
[20:42:33] <sudden6> so to recap style 1: "src/path/to/locla" and <System/Include.h>
[20:44:00] <sudden6> and style 2: "localinclude.h" "src/project/level.h" and <System/include.h>
[20:44:08] <sudden6> did I do it right this time?
[20:44:34] <sudden6> I'll comment on the PR and mention antis81 and initramfs then
[20:45:23] <Diadlo> New qt creator don't search include files in `/usr/include` by default :/
[20:45:35] <iphy> Style 2 is ../subsystem/module.h
[20:46:23] <iphy> Style 2 is enforceable by compiler
[20:46:35] <iphy> Style 1 needs two grep rules
[20:47:58] <iphy> The style 2 you describe is hard to enforce, and at least n(log n) time for n headers
[20:48:27] <sudden6> hmm, if i look at the qTox directory structure, your style 2 could turn into "../../../../subsystem/module.h" which isn't very pretty IMHO
[20:48:39] <iphy> Agreed
[20:49:10] <Diadlo> + ^
[20:49:36] <sudden6> so, style 1 as RFC for antis81 and initramfs?
[20:50:08] <iphy> I'll have a test in the cmake build for style 1
[20:50:25] <iphy> Basically the two line script I wrote here in the channel

[22:25:26] <initramfs> Sorry I haven't really worked on that, I still don't have a clear consensus on what the decided format should be
[22:26:07] <initramfs> I mean, are we following Qt's coding style now? Or are there exceptions?
[22:27:50] <iphy> initramfs: you'll probably want to run clang-format with all the different options until you find a minimal diff
[22:27:59] <iphy> then you have a style that mostly matches what's there
[22:28:24] <initramfs> Well yeah I know... But that's not what this is aiming for though
[22:28:33] <iphy> you could brute force that over night, I don't think clang-format has a lot of options
[22:28:38] <initramfs> I think we are aiming for an established coding standard
[22:28:45] <initramfs> Not a "best fir" to what we have now
[22:28:47] <iphy> well then just pick one
[22:28:55] <initramfs> s/best fir/best fit/
[22:28:58] <initramfs> Well I have
[22:29:09] <iphy> it doesn't really matter what coding standard you pick, as long as it can be automated and enforced
[22:29:23] <iphy> LLVM, Google, ...
[22:29:24] <initramfs> Well
[22:29:48] <initramfs> Right now, I've already have a clang-format standard created that caters to qTox's established standards
[22:30:09] <initramfs> But it was proposed to use a pre-established standard verbatim
[22:30:39] <initramfs> At risk of stepping on other people's toes, I don't want to just go in propose something that requires most of the codebase to be rewritten and have people hate it
[22:31:16] <initramfs> And given that qTox already has an established standard (though a minimal one) my idea was just to extend that
[22:32:36] <iphy> ah
[22:32:45] <iphy> where is that established standard documented?
[22:33:06] <initramfs> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#coding-guidelines
[22:33:43] <initramfs> Part of my clang-format branch was to add a new CODING_STYLE.md that describes more rules for qTox's style after the PR
[22:34:05] <iphy> your coding style only needs to describe rules that clang-format can't enforce
[22:35:12] <iphy> asterisksGoWithTheType silly C++ programmers refuse to accept C++ operator precedence rules
[22:36:14] <iphy> E.g. https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/src/misc/flowlayout.cpp <- that's a dead link
[22:38:32] <iphy> the example doesn't follow the rules: https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/src/widget/flowlayout.cpp#L58
[22:38:42] <initramfs> I know
[22:38:55] <iphy> like, ever
[22:39:00] <initramfs> That's also why I was somewhat against just brute forcing clang format against the existing code base
[22:39:02] <iphy> (which is good, because that rule makes no sense)
[22:39:12] <initramfs> Because there is so many "rule violations"
[22:39:29] <zetok> ><initramfs> At risk of stepping on other people's toes, I don't want to just go in propose something that requires most of the codebase to be rewritten and have people hate it

[22:40:04] <initramfs> The last discussion however suggested that my efforts were unwarranted
[22:40:08] <initramfs> Anyway
[22:40:15] <zetok> um?
[22:40:45] <initramfs> Well, the last discussion on this topic that I was a part of had Diadlo say to use Qt's coding style verbatim
[22:41:24] <initramfs> Okay, you know what, I'll just finish this branch on what I was doing, open a PR and have people discuss on that
[22:41:26] <iphy> which means?
[22:42:08] <initramfs> iphy: Well, that meant all the previous work I did to find clang format rules (and write appropriate coding standard examples) were nullified if we were to simply use Qt's coding style
[22:42:10] <iphy> attach braces to control structures
[22:43:12] <zetok> >Okay, you know what, I'll just finish this branch on what I was doing, open a PR and have people discuss on that
[22:43:16] <zetok> that would be the best
[22:43:17] <iphy> (which incidentally is what toxcore does)
[22:43:31] <iphy> it might be nice to have a common coding standard in all tox projects
