[11:34:39] <sudden6> I still can't reproduce your bug from yesterday, I setup a XFCE VM and still nothing

[11:44:32] <zetok> -.-"
[11:44:55] <zetok> wtf, I can't reproduce it on the same qTox instance that I was able to reproduce yesterday
[11:45:23] <zetok> I just clicked on "Reconnect" in settings to get qGroupbot to show up -.-
[11:47:36] <zetok> oh wait
[11:47:43] * zetok facepalms
[11:49:17] <zetok> no wonder that I couldn't reproduce without following the steps…
[11:53:50] <nurupo> zetok: sounds like the ffmpeg fix works https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3612#issuecomment-244592324

[11:54:51] <nurupo> we have also updated the nsis to the 3.x version, which should add windows 10 support or something like that
[11:55:05] <nurupo> i wonder if someone tested it and it actually works
[11:55:27] <zetok> nurupo: sounds great, thanks :)
[11:55:35] <nurupo> because if tux3 rebuilds the stable qtox, it will use the nsis 3.0, which previous stable qtox build didn't use
[11:55:54] <nurupo> so beware of that
[11:57:15] <zetok> sounds like "fun"

[14:43:56] <C0rn3j___> Hiya! Am trying to use qTox between multiple devices. I've noticed that the files are being saved in ~/.config/qtox, so I copied them to my dropbox folder, deleted them in the config folder and tried importing them, which succeeded but it's now apparently saving it back to the home folder, and not my dropbox folder? I didn't find an option to change this behavior
[14:52:25] <cisc> C0rn3j___: that's the path where qtox saves its config files, in the user's ~/.config
[14:55:08] <zetok> C0rn3j___: you're doing it wrong :(
[14:56:03] <zetok> C0rn3j___: dunno about your dropbox config, but uploading the files to "the cloud" is ~wrong
[14:56:32] <zetok> C0rn3j___: i.e. if you have an encryption on them at least you didn't expose your pk/sk and history to everyone
[14:56:47] <zetok> (encryption – password in qTox)
[14:57:12] <zetok> C0rn3j___: what you might want to use is syncthing
[14:58:23] <zetok> C0rn3j___: aside from that, you might want to look into XDG_CONFIG_DIR
[14:58:45] <zetok> if you have it pointing at your HOME, you have misconfigured system

[14:59:11] <zetok> (if I understood correctly what you're asking about)
[14:59:25] <zetok> btw, config is in ~/.config/tox
[14:59:44] <zetok> (it's better to not "cloud" it)
[15:01:36] <zetok> oh wait
[15:01:42] <zetok> misunderstood your question
[15:01:58] <zetok> yeah, stuff is going to be saved in ~/.config
[15:02:16] <zetok> but the variable I've listed above would help you :)
[15:02:26] <zetok> (export it just for qTox :) )
[15:15:33] <sudden6> zetok: whats the tool you used to screencast? I still can't repro...
[15:15:47] <zetok> simplescreenrecorder
[15:16:15] <zetok> alternative is to use ffmpeg directly, but I couldn't get a good framerate with that
[15:16:25] <zetok> (not sure what I was doing wrong)

[15:29:42] <zetok> sudden6: have you tried to just remove/add a letter?
[15:30:01] <sudden6> ? yes, I think I have
[15:30:04] <sudden6> will test
[15:30:48] <zetok> sudden6: also, could you try with qgroupbot's groupchat?
[15:30:52] <sudden6> no reaction
[15:32:01] <zetok> sudden6: btw, click on the emoji picker before changing topic for the first time
[15:32:13] <sudden6> I did, I think
[15:32:25] <zetok> um, wasn't visible on screencast
[15:32:35] <zetok> perhaps a frame was dropped or something
[15:32:50] <sudden6> will retry
[15:33:24] <sudden6> reproduceable on qgroupchat!
[15:33:38] <sudden6> now, the question is why
[15:33:39] <zetok> ah.
[15:33:46] <zetok> probably my null
[15:33:47] <zetok> :|
[15:33:59] <sudden6> that would be really odd
[15:34:04] <zetok> not really
[15:34:11] <zetok> lots of things break with it
[15:34:38] <sudden6> still
[15:34:44] <zetok> yeah :D
[15:35:09] <sudden6> why is qgroupbot so slow to invite?
[15:35:28] <zetok> yes and no
[15:35:42] <zetok> if it's about sending an invite, it's instantaneous
[15:36:04] <zetok> if it's about actual join, that doesn't really depend only on qgroupbot, but also on other groupchat peers AFAIK
[15:36:36] <sudden6> ah, sorry just didn't see the invite
[15:40:01] <sudden6> crap, the code that's causing that is undocumented...
[15:40:42] <zetok> IIRC the code that introduced bug was fixed some other problem
[15:40:49] <zetok> was fixing*
[15:48:16] <sudden6> do you remember which PR it was?

[15:48:44] <zetok> sorry, no

[15:49:17] <zetok> too long ago, by now I just remember that it couldn't be simply reverted
[15:54:48] <sudden6> I think it's not your nick which is causing that
[15:55:06] <sudden6> because it happens also after groupchat split due to debugging
[15:55:16] <zetok> ok :)
[15:55:30] <sudden6> actually that's bad
[15:55:39] <zetok> oh :(
[15:56:49] <sudden6> if it was your nick I would just say change it :P
[15:57:06] <zetok> the standard answer is as always 'no' :D
