[00:41:14] <zetok> toxdns was deprecated long time ago
[00:42:43] <witheld> what is toxme?
[00:42:47] <witheld> Googling it brings up a single site
[00:49:04] *** Joins: cisc (~cisc@ )
[00:51:50] <zetok> witheld: https://github.com/LittleVulpix/toxme
[00:53:18] <witheld> And how's this work exactly, what do usernames look like now?
[00:53:40] <zetok> same as always
[00:54:27] <zetok> I mean, it uses https and rest api, but for the end-user it works the ~same, except for the better integration in the client
[00:55:00] <zetok> witheld: you can try with the bot listed in topic ;)
[00:55:29] <witheld> So it's still user@domain?
[00:55:45] <zetok> yep
[00:55:54] <witheld> huh okay
[00:56:39] <zetok> actually, AFAIK you now don't even need a domain
[00:56:56] <witheld> But instead of using DNS it's using our own servers or....how is this decentralized exactly?
[00:57:29] <zetok> it's ~not
[00:57:47] <zetok> toxdns wasn't decentralized either though
[00:58:15] <witheld> Yeah but, DNS is at least you know...a big organization that's kind of decentralized of itself
[00:58:25] <zetok> as for servers, it's the same as before – you can run your own instance
[00:58:46] <zetok> um.
[00:59:03] <witheld> politically decentralized
[00:59:15] <zetok> since when?
[01:00:21] <witheld> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN#Structure
[01:00:24] <witheld> a while
[01:00:31] <zetok> "sure"
[01:01:34] <zetok> anyway, now you don't even need DNS :)
[01:01:55] <zetok> and e.g. `user@dead::beef` is possible
[01:02:02] <witheld> I'm just confused- it seems like we replaced DNS with a hardcoded list of username servers?
[01:02:15] <zetok> there's no hardcoded list
[01:02:38] <witheld> How does it work?
[01:03:08] <witheld> Like if I run my own server, I can start handing out usernames from it and every client has a way to look up usernames from that server with no extra effort?
[01:03:21] <zetok> ~yep
[01:03:41] <zetok> um, your client choice is a bit limited though
[01:03:48] <witheld> How does it look them up?
[01:04:27] <zetok> um?
[01:04:41] <zetok> client sends a query to a server
[01:04:53] <witheld> how does it know about my server
[01:05:00] *** Quits: smaragdus (~omoo@ ) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[01:05:15] <zetok> you have to tell client about your server..
[01:05:21] <witheld> ...
[01:05:46] <witheld> So, there is extra effort, the user has to manually go add my server to their list of servers to look up nicks from
[01:05:59] * zetok sighs
[01:06:03] <witheld> This is significantly worse than the old solution
[01:06:15] <zetok> ><zetok> same as always
[01:06:21] <zetok> witheld: have you tried to use it?
[01:06:31] <witheld> The idea of ToxDNS is that it was federated
[01:06:48] <witheld> You could do username@arbitrarydomain and it would look up arbitrary domain using DNS
[01:06:52] <zetok> same goes for toxme
[01:07:01] <witheld> that's federation
[01:07:03] <zetok> except for no dependency on the dns
[01:07:07] <witheld> manually adding sources to a list is not federation
[01:07:09] <witheld> it's a hostfile
[01:07:16] <zetok> sure.
[01:07:26] <zetok> please come back after you try
[01:07:38] <zetok> (I might have worded things wrongly)
[01:09:43] <witheld> Alright I've got qtox and I don't know what to try here
[01:09:56] <zetok> :)
[01:10:01] <witheld> how do I look up usernames from something that isn't toxme.io

[01:10:52] <zetok> with toxme
[01:11:05] <zetok> ><zetok> ><zetok> same as always

[01:11:44] <tobiasBora> 1) Thank you for this great software, (q)Tox is amaizing
[01:11:46] <zetok> witheld: it's just the protocol used that has changed

[01:29:02] <tobiasBora> If I am on the same lan as my friend, is it supposed to go faster ?
[01:29:43] <zetok> toxcore will try to use direct UDP, but if a connection can't be made, it'll use TCP relay, which is ~slow
[01:31:26] <tobiasBora> And when direct UDP is possible ? Both adress must have a reachable IP adress, or it has nothing to do with it ? For example if my friend is 500km away, am I sure to be redirected to TCP or not ?
[01:31:50] <zetok> nope
[01:33:58] <zetok> toxcore tries by default UDP, if it doesn't want to work, it switches to TCP
[01:34:08] <tobiasBora> ok

[17:44:44] <zetok> hmm
[17:44:59] <sudden6> qtox does bootstrap node randomization internally
[17:44:59] <zetok> does qTox pick bootstraps from the list "randomly" ?
[17:45:04] <zetok> oh, ok then
[17:45:59] <sudden6> btw, your tool doesn't handle empty lines well, it counts them as nodes and thus breaks settings.ini format
[17:46:13] <zetok> \o/
[17:46:18] <zetok> I mean, I'll fix that
[17:46:57] <zetok> nodes-parser-for-qtox ?
[17:47:16] <sudden6> we should write the process of updating bootstrap nodes down somewhere, I don't even remember when I started on this project xD
[17:47:19] <sudden6> yes
[17:48:00] <sudden6> zetok: also your tool is missing the first line of settings ini: [DHT%20server]
[17:48:17] <zetok> right
[17:48:19] <sudden6> * [DHT%20Server]
[17:49:21] <sudden6> maybe we could even make it into a full unix pipe, eg. wget | json-parser | online-checker | qtox-formatter
[17:49:36] <zetok> yeah
[17:50:31] <zetok> I've made tools use files, since I wasn't at the time familiar with std{in,out} in Rust
[17:50:52] <zetok> second bug fixed
[17:50:59] <sudden6> yeah, this is only a thing that would be "cool" imho ;)
[17:51:15] *** Quits: abbat (~abbat@ ) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[17:53:41] <zetok> ok, first bug fixed too
[17:54:18] <zetok> is the line really "empty", or could it contain whitespaces?
[17:54:36] <zetok> because I just did `.filter(|l| !l.is_empty())`
[17:54:46] <zetok> and that won't work if there are whitespaces
[17:55:25] <sudden6> could be that there's a whitespace in it
[17:56:05] <zetok> um
[17:57:03] <zetok> sudden6: could you send me input sample?
[17:58:12] <sudden6> I deleted it -_-, I think it was either one or more spaces or one or more newlines at the end of the file
[18:01:13] <zetok> ok, can reproduce
[18:02:21] <sudden6> I also sorted the nodes by maintainer name, for smaller diffs

[20:53:11] <Diadl0> IDK, how GitLab work. But I think, we can start from creating mirror of github repository
[20:53:26] <zetok> not really
[20:53:27] <zetok> :s
[20:53:30] <Diadl0> Why?
[20:53:35] <zetok> it will error out
[20:53:39] <zetok> :|
[20:54:20] <Diadl0> Hm... I.e. GitLab has this functionality, but it's doesn't work?
[20:54:22] <zetok> thing is, current GitLab implementation can have problems with just a few dozens of issues/PRs
[20:54:48] <zetok> with our repo that has thousands of issues/PRs and >16k comments it will fail
[20:55:07] <zetok> and when it fails to import a project from github, it leaves behind a mess
[20:55:12] <Diadl0> But migration on GitLab has same problem :)
[20:55:29] <Diadl0> Right?
[20:55:41] <zetok> yes and no
[20:55:48] <Diadl0> Why "no"?
[20:56:11] <zetok> migrating gitlab ↔ gitlab can error out, but IIRC not with things we would care about
[20:57:06] <Diadl0> You mean github <-> gitlab ?
[20:57:20] <zetok> no ;)
[20:57:34] <Diadl0> Ok. So why you talk about it?)
[20:57:38] <zetok> but I meant github → gitlab earlier
[20:58:16] <zetok> >But migration on GitLab has same problem :)
[20:58:23] <zetok> did you mean gh by any chance?
[20:59:09] <zetok> https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/17995
[20:59:09] <Diadl0> Sorry, I don't understand
[20:59:47] <zetok> that makes both of us >.<
[21:00:25] <zetok> >But I think, we can start from creating mirror of github repository
[21:00:48] <zetok> Diadl0: you were asking about importing on GL project from gh, right?
[21:00:57] <Diadl0> Yep
[21:01:00] <zetok> ok
[21:01:09] <zetok> technically, we /could/ do that
[21:01:29] <zetok> but it would make repository on gh in mess
[21:01:45] <zetok> (since imported is buggy)
[21:01:49] <zetok> importer*
[21:02:09] <Diadl0> What kind of mess?
[21:02:17] *** Quits: _Happy__ (2e1c25e2@ ) (Quit: Page closed)
[21:02:28] <zetok> up to thousands of branches on repo
[21:02:37] <Diadl0> Ok
[21:02:44] <Diadl0> What about start with creating just code mirror?
[21:02:53] <Diadl0> I.e. drop all issues
[21:03:00] <Diadl0> We can do it?
[21:03:06] <zetok> yep, but that's kinda pointless
[21:03:32] <zetok> since mirroring just the code is not a problem
[21:04:00] <zetok> the problem is all of the data other than code associated with it
[21:04:03] <Diadl0> "that's kinda pointless" <- Nope. Just see on `positive side` in your mail :)
[21:04:18] <zetok> err
[21:04:27] <zetok> code was never a problem
[21:05:02] <zetok> everyone and their dog has a copy of it, and it wouldn't cause any problems to make a repo with it
[21:05:34] <zetok> it's the data other than code that currently can be taken down & never recovered
[21:05:36] <Diadl0> But issues can be created again
[21:05:42] <zetok> from what?
[21:05:47] <Diadl0> From users
[21:06:01] <zetok> how?
[21:06:20] <Diadl0> Like they create it on github :/
[21:06:25] <zetok> ?
[21:06:42] <Diadl0> GitLab support issues system?
[21:06:45] <zetok> you mean to ask hundreds of people to exactly recreate all the issues?
[21:06:52] <zetok> manually?
[21:07:02] <zetok> and how would they have that data?
[21:07:10] <Diadl0> Like create new project
[21:07:32] <Diadl0> Just forget about github project
[21:07:44] <zetok> and then have commits & code comments pointing at wrong issues?
[21:07:46] <Diadl0> It's hard
[21:08:03] <Diadl0> GitLab can start issues from some number?
[21:08:07] <zetok> nope
[21:08:20] <zetok> I get your idea, but it's essentially wrong
[21:08:27] <Diadl0> Ok. Yes. Old commits will point on wrong issues
[21:08:56] <Diadl0> It's just my opinion. Do we have another way now?
[21:09:23] <zetok> yeah, wait a bit for gitlab to fix their stuff
[21:09:44] <Diadl0> It will be perfect
[21:10:56] <Diadl0> So, it they someday fix all issues (from your mail) we will have no problem :)
[21:11:44] <zetok> not really
[21:11:48] <Diadl0> Why?
[21:11:51] <zetok> osx thing is not going to change
[21:12:07] <Diadl0> Principle?
[21:12:13] <zetok> cost
[21:12:21] <Diadl0> Oh...
[21:12:41] <Diadl0> What about windows?
[21:12:42] <zetok> thing is, it's possible to run GitLabCI on osx
[21:12:47] <zetok> (same for windows)
[21:12:54] <Diadl0> "perfect"
[21:13:00] <zetok> it's just that we would need to provide that stuff for ourself
[21:13:23] <zetok> i.e. pay for servers with it

[21:34:11] <zetok> the `else` clause applies

[21:34:50] <Diadl0> It's perfect. But I don't understand. What I should do?)

[21:36:08] <zetok> commit rename step is missing, but it's not required there
