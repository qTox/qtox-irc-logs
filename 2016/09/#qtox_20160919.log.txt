[22:18:06] <nurupo> QMetaObject::invokeMethod takes a function name as a char* argument
[22:18:11] *** Quits: abbat (~abbat@ ) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:18:39] <nurupo> which leads to finding out that such function/method doesn't exist only at run-time
[22:18:56] <nurupo> like the Qt4-style signal-slot connections
