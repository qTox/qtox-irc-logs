[00:07:14] <zetok> Diadlo: pong
[00:31:32] <nurupo> yep, not by default
[00:31:49] <nurupo> you can `new(std::nothrow)` to ask it to return null instead of throwing an exception

[00:34:47] <Neolex> Hi
[00:46:57] <Neolex> I dont know where to start :(
[00:47:44] <nurupo> initramfs_: the is also a thing with Linux overcommitment memory allocation model
[00:48:04] <nurupo> even if there is not enough memory to malloc(512), malloc won't fail
[00:48:17] <initramfs_> Right
[00:48:50] <nurupo> linux would try to allocate that much memory the first time the memory segment pointed be what malloc returned is accessed
[00:49:09] <nurupo> and if then there is not enough memory, your application would get killed
[00:49:18] <nurupo> or something like that
[00:49:19] <zetok> Neolex: ok, what you're trying to do?
[00:49:19] *** Quits: abbat (~Anton@ ) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:50:06] <Neolex> zetok: I want to fix the issue #3334 . Set a parameter for the port 
[00:50:57] <Neolex> But the servers are on the port 33445 so we cant set a random port ? 
[00:51:10] <zetok> um
[00:51:17] <zetok> that doesn't matter
[00:51:34] <zetok> the problem here is that the functionality isn't in toxcore
[00:51:58] <zetok> random port would work just fine
[00:52:05] <zetok> (if toxcore supported that)
[00:52:10] <Neolex> ok :/
[00:52:35] <Neolex> so it's not that easy ? I chose an easy issue to start
[00:52:59] <zetok> Neolex: you can develop against irungentoo/toxcore `new` branch, but it would seem that some(?) time has to pass before it'll get to toxcore that qTox uses
[00:52:59] <Neolex> so we have to wait for toxcore to implement that ?
[00:53:31] <zetok> so your PR with changes would most likely wait long time before getting merged
[00:53:41] <zetok> >so we have to wait for toxcore to implement that ?
[00:53:45] <zetok> only for merging PR
[00:53:58] <zetok> also, there's this thing with migrating to TokTok/toxcore
[00:54:38] <zetok> TokTok/toxcore most likely will support the functionality, but probably with (slightly?) different API
[00:55:06] <Neolex> ok ok

[00:57:13] <nurupo> zetok: you can tell toxcore which UDP port you want it to use
[00:57:26] <nurupo> so the functionality is in the toxcore

[00:58:49] <zetok> upnp isn't in toxcore?
[00:59:46] <zetok> Neolex: sorry, for the whole functionality from the issue you'd need to wait, for just setting the port the stuff is already there

[01:00:49] <nurupo> ok then

[01:09:05] <Neolex> zetok: ok thank you :)
[01:09:08] <zetok> np
[01:10:01] <iphy> regarding new branch
[01:10:14] <iphy> it entirely depends on irungentoo how this collaboration will work
[01:10:27] <Neolex> why does it need a range of port , and not just on port ?
[01:10:46] <iphy> he has shown zero interest in our work, but I'm still hoping we can work together
[01:10:47] <Neolex> so the users should choose the range and not only the port ?
[01:11:01] <iphy> so I've opened a PR to try and bring toktok and irungentoo's repo closer together
[01:11:18] <iphy> it's up to irungentoo to either ignore us or work with us
[01:11:28] <zetok> Neolex: there can be other tox instances running, and they can already occupy first ports in range, in this case toxcore tries to bind to the next port in order
[01:11:36] <iphy> either way, we'll slowly pick things out of the new branch and bring them through our regular review process
[01:11:51] <Neolex> zetok: ah yes of course , thanks ^^

[08:22:23] <zetok> >| toxcore       | >= 0.0.1    | core, av 
[08:22:27] <zetok> dunno about version
[08:22:36] <zetok> 0.0.1 doesn't sound like a stable API
[08:22:53] <zetok> s/doesn't sound like/is not/
[08:23:55] <Diadlo> So I should stop working with this migration until toxcore version < 0.1.0 ?
[08:24:25] <zetok> no?
[08:24:43] <Diadlo> What I should do?)
[08:24:45] <zetok> it's just that there's no point in merging PR until there's a ~stable toxcore API
[08:25:18] <Diadlo> Ok
[08:25:23] <zetok> if you think that you won't be wasting time, you can work on the PR
[08:26:09] <zetok> btw, I don't know whether toxcore compiling instructions are still correct with TokTok
[08:27:06] <zetok> ok, TokTok docs didn't seem to have changed, so it should be fine
[08:30:34] <zetok> Diadlo: aside from version, things look fine; once there'll be `v0.1.0` tag, scripts should `git checkout` it

[11:25:36] <sudden6> why?
[11:25:39] <Diadlo> o/
[11:26:07] <sudden6> you mean, because I created the UI redesign project?
[11:26:55] <zetok> sudden6: yep, I'm wondering what I've missed in their functionality that milestones offer?
[11:27:31] <zetok> milestones don't offer*
[11:27:59] <sudden6> you can put tasks in different groups, but I think that was it
[11:28:10] <zetok> hm.
[11:28:30] <zetok> right now it's redundant
[11:29:02] <sudden6> like for example take the next release, we could do "TODO" "WIP" and "DONE" categories to get a quick overview what needs to be done
[11:29:21] <zetok> err
[11:29:36] <zetok> that's precisely what milestones offer
[11:29:40] <sudden6> but for that to work out, we have to create issues for every TODO task
[11:29:42] <sudden6> yep
[11:29:52] <sudden6> just a different UI
[11:30:30] <zetok> so there's basically no reason to use them?
[11:30:34] <Diadlo> It reminds me rooms vs virtual desktops in KDE
[11:30:54] <sudden6> whats rooms?^^
[11:31:27] <zetok> the other thing
[11:31:39] <zetok> -.-"
[11:31:44] <sudden6> never heard of that^^
[11:32:28] <Diadlo> sudden6: Sorry, wrong translation. It's "Activities"
[11:32:48] <sudden6> ah, yeah I never got what they are for :DD
[11:33:37] <Diadlo> It's like virtual desktops with different widgets
[11:34:20] <sudden6> mhm, I used to make extensive use of widgets and heavily customize my desktop in my kde beginner days
[11:34:43] <sudden6> but nowadays I barely care
[11:35:55] <Diadlo> I never loved widgets =/
[11:38:25] <zetok> hmm
[11:40:30] <Diadlo> I think, `Project` feature should replace non-version related part of milestone

[14:42:31] <zetok> bullshit
[14:42:34] <zetok> that makes 0 sense
[14:42:49] <sudden6> it makes 1000 sense
[14:42:50] <zetok> sudden6: you've missed what the real problem is
[14:42:57] <sudden6> ah?
[14:43:10] <zetok> problem is confusing UI
[14:43:23] <zetok> and you want to "fix" that problem by making UI more confusing?
[14:43:50] <sudden6> uhm, no? declaring virtual inputs as such makes it less confusing
[14:44:09] <zetok> again, bullshit
[14:44:24] <zetok> whole virtual thing makes 0 sense
[14:44:42] <zetok> user *doesn't know and doesn't care* about some "virtual"
[14:45:14] <sudden6> then make a a better proposal
[14:45:21] <zetok> generally, UI doesn't become less confusing by adding stuff that is not understandable
[14:45:35] <zetok> sudden6: and again, that's not the problem here
[14:46:01] <zetok> sudden6: as for proposal – I have an idea, but about that later
[14:46:08] <sudden6> you said, the problem is the confusing UI
[14:46:18] <zetok> yes, in that issue
[14:46:22] <sudden6> I like the solution in that issue
[14:46:32] <zetok> …
[14:46:36] <zetok> and that's the second problem
[14:47:23] <sudden6> then please straight up tell me what the problems you see are and how you intend to solve them
[14:49:04] <zetok> um, so.
[14:49:43] <zetok> sudden6: the problem is that the horrible proposal was accepted
[14:50:22] <zetok> as for solving that
[14:50:45] <zetok> generally, most of proposals (>90%?) are *shit*
[14:51:46] <sudden6> ↑ can agree
[14:51:46] <zetok> people don't know what they actually want; if they do know what they want, proposed solutions are outright *bad*; and if solution is not bad for them, then it's very likely that it would negatively affect workflow of other people
[14:52:28] <zetok> in this case thanks to your intervention it went from shit to just horrible
[14:52:41] <zetok> but horrible is still not something that should be accepted
[14:53:47] *** Joins: f10_ (~flo@ )

[14:55:15] <zetok> thanks
[14:55:43] <sudden6> I think one problem we have is that nobody really knows how to design good UI
[14:55:59] <zetok> ~yeah
[14:56:09] <zetok> hmm
[14:56:15] <sudden6> and there's no general "unified" design approach
[14:56:46] <sudden6> ie everybody has their own ideas and sooner or later we'll have a huge clusterfuck of UI elements
[14:56:47] <zetok> so, even with people who are actual designers things aren't always nice
[14:57:31] <zetok> based on my experience with people who tried to design a better, consistent UI for a tox client
[14:58:14] <zetok> >everybody has their own ideas and sooner or later we'll have a huge clusterfuck of UI elements
