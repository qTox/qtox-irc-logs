[15:19:52] <Diadlo> Ups, sorry
[15:19:57] <Diadlo> zetok: ping
[15:20:11] <zetok> Diadlo: pong
[15:20:31] <Diadlo> Lets talk about https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3704 :)
[15:21:19] <Diadlo> If we can guarantee, that user have correct date, it's 10+ digits (after 2002 year)
[15:22:06] <Diadlo> If user have some system problem, date can be reseted
[15:22:27] <zetok> right
[15:22:55] <Diadlo> Should I leave `{1,}` ?
[15:23:38] <zetok> what are the chances of timestamp being reverted to the "beginning of the time" ?
[15:24:09] <Diadlo> I have old laptop which reset date every reboot :)
[15:25:01] <Diadlo> But we can up it to ~5 (10s = 10000ms = 5 digits)
[15:25:20] <zetok> ok
[15:25:24] <Diadlo> Exist any real reason to all those changes?)
[15:25:34] <zetok> performance
[15:25:45] <zetok> the "smaller" the regex, the faster it'll be
[15:25:53] <zetok> >\dMatches a digit (QChar::isDigit()).
[15:26:39] <zetok> also, using stuff that is pre-defined is generally faster than defining stuff on its own
[15:26:45] <Diadlo> This method will be called only on some errors
[15:27:02] <Diadlo> It is so rare... :)
[15:27:41] <zetok> err
[15:27:47] <Diadlo> Why?
[15:27:59] <Diadlo> i.e. 5 digits will be normal?
[15:28:19] <zetok> thing is, if it's about errors, they can and will be "spammed" a lot
[15:28:47] <zetok> so performance there is important too
[15:29:11] <zetok> Diadlo: it makes scope of the regex smaller
[15:29:40] <Diadlo> I understand
[15:29:56] <Diadlo> So, 5+ ?
[15:30:01] <zetok> yep

[18:29:02] <zetok> yeah, I just don't remember what exactly I wanted to ask about
[18:31:57] <sudden6> I will run the bootstrap node update programs today, maybe you could do the same and then we combine the online nodes?
[18:32:07] <zetok> oh, right
[18:32:09] <zetok> :D
[18:32:15] <zetok> that's the thing I wanted to ask about :D
[18:32:24] <sudden6> ah, well xD
[18:33:44] <zetok> um, I don't have a "clean" LAN, so the check will be full of false-positives for me
[18:34:32] <sudden6> ah, crap me neither...
[18:34:47] <sudden6> well, I'll run it on my server then
[18:38:27] <sudden6> can rust easily build a static binary for your online checker?
[18:40:36] <sudden6> zetok: â†‘
[18:43:05] <zetok> yes and no
[18:43:16] <zetok> actually, no
[18:43:32] <sudden6> well then a local run on an unknown network has to suffice
[18:43:35] <zetok> the C part is problematic
[18:44:02] <zetok> um, by "clean" LAN I mean one that doesn't have other tox instances running on it
[18:44:23] <zetok> >can rust easily build a static binary for your online checker?
[18:44:37] <zetok> once zetox is sufficiently advanced, that'll be "yes"
[18:44:44] <sudden6> I know, but I don't know if any tox instances are running
[18:44:53] <zetok> I see
[18:45:14] <sudden6> actually, I'm silly, I have a router between my lan and the dorm lan
[18:46:00] <sudden6> which also does vpn *facepalm*

[19:58:32] <sudden6> Diadlo: hi :)
[19:58:49] <Diadlo> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3711#issuecomment-246768470
[19:59:10] <Diadlo> What comment I should refer?
[19:59:38] <sudden6> This one https://github.com/Diadlo/qTox/blob/1bbe1c948ef52adbee9cc71e615930ab19aec65f/src/persistence/settings.cpp#L177
[19:59:57] <sudden6> because it has to be changed when this part is removed, or am I wrong?
[20:01:11] <Diadlo> Yes. Ok, and how I should refer it? Line number will be incorrect, because it can be changed
[20:02:28] <sudden6> yeah, line number is bad, maybe we should copy the toxcore style and assign all TODOs to an issue?
[20:03:01] <sudden6> ie TODO: #1234 remove when old settings are deprecated
[20:03:23] <Diadlo> Where the 1234 is PR number?
[20:03:33] <sudden6> issue number
[20:04:03] <sudden6> we would have to create one for deprecating old settings, but I think it would be good anyway
[20:04:44] <Diadlo> Agree
[20:04:50] <Diadlo> zetok: ^
[20:05:43] <zetok> hmm
[20:10:52] <zetok> so
[20:11:06] <zetok> "old" settings is relative
[20:11:22] <zetok> and there will be more settings in the future that will become "old"
[20:11:27] <sudden6> yup
[20:12:01] <Diadlo> It can me metabug with list of places, where old code should be removed
[20:12:13] <Diadlo> Or create many small issues
[20:12:16] <Diadlo> Or both :)
[20:12:23] *** Joins: initramfs (~initramfs@ )
[20:12:34] <zetok> aside from that, I think that just adding comments in the code when something needs to be deprecated would do, e.g. `TODO: remove @ 2017.. ; read above`
[20:12:55] <sudden6> maybe use a common title?
[20:13:14] <sudden6> but I think comments will be overlooked after some time
[20:14:19] <zetok> what should be the deprecation period for settings?
[20:14:30] <zetok> 2 stable releases?
[20:15:11] <sudden6> same as old history deprecation?
[20:15:19] <zetok> um
[20:15:25] <zetok> settings aren't that important
[20:15:29] <sudden6> doesn't make sense to have different periods for that
[20:16:07] <zetok> long deprecation period is justifiable only for backwards compatibility with user data
[20:16:25] <Diadlo> Settings is user data too
[20:16:31] <zetok> no.
[20:16:37] <Diadlo> ?
[20:17:06] <zetok> i.e. in current implementation, qTox has user data in settings

[22:15:01] <sudden6> uhm, does anyone know how many ipv6 addresses one should order per server?
[22:15:30] <Emcy_> doesnt everyone get a billion
[22:16:04] <sudden6> idk, my hosting provider just asked me how many addresses I want, I wasn't prepared for that question
[22:18:04] <oranges> a \64
[22:18:08] <oranges> I think is the usual assignment
[22:18:22] <oranges> that gives you 18,000,000,000,000,000  addresses
[22:18:32] <oranges> if you need multiple subnets you might want a /60 or a /46
[22:18:35] <oranges> err 56
[22:18:42] <sudden6> what the hell should I do with that many addresses?!
[22:19:17] <initramfs> Well, given that IPv6 is 128-bits, it really doesn't matter to them or you, how many addresses are allocated
[22:19:31] <initramfs> s/IPv6/IPv6 addresses/
[22:19:38] <initramfs> s/is/are/
[22:19:55] <sudden6> okay, I'll then ask for a /64 block
[22:20:12] <oranges> well you could simulate the entire ipv4 internet
[22:20:13] <oranges> for fun
[22:20:15] <oranges> or something
[22:20:38] <oranges> a /64 is the minimum required for ipv6 stateless configuration
[22:20:57] <oranges> plus if you handed out anything smaller you would end up with huge routing tables
[22:21:13] <oranges> like
[22:21:22] <oranges> the amount of space in ipv6 is difficult to grasp
[22:21:43] <oranges> http://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2005-07/ipv6size.html is a good primer
[22:22:33] <oranges> they're really planning for a large number of small interconnected devices in each househould I imagine
[22:23:55] <sudden6> interconnected nanobots are comming
[22:24:10] * sudden6 We are BORG, resistance is futile!
[22:24:48] <initramfs> sudden6: I mean, you can literally have MAC addresses embedded into the IPv6 addresses of devices
