[02:23:52] <C0rn3j> Hiya, just a question about Tox IDs. I've sent my ID to my friend and he added me, I accepted.  Now I am trying to add him from a different profile, but apparently when I click view details on his profile in qTox it only gives me his ID without the nospam block, and Antox doesn't take that as a valid ID. Is iit not a valid ID in general and I need my friend to tell me the whole ID too?
[02:24:33] <Emcy_> you need a valid nospam to disturb someone. That is the point
[02:25:02] <Emcy_> the thing is shows is the pubkey, the full thing is toxid
[02:25:26] <C0rn3j> Right, so I need to bug him for an ID, thanks.
[02:25:53] <Emcy_> its expected you add people to your tox by some prior arrangement i think
[02:26:26] <Emcy_> so thats requesting the ID from the person you know for sure is who you think they are. Thats the authentication part of the security model.
[02:26:29] <Emcy_> ideally in person
[02:27:11] <Emcy_> i mean, tox is not aol chatrooms. Its for freinds to talk to friends
[02:27:49] *** Quits: toweI (~toweI@ ) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:28:03] <Emcy_> when MD is implemented you want have to fuck around with a profile for each device anyway
[02:28:08] <Emcy_> that will be a huge usability boon

[11:56:13] <barmaley> i have idea for qtox
[11:58:06] <barmaley> when some contact in qtox is go online, need function, play sound(user set path to play sound). it need to hear what exactly contact go back onlive, for example to very important conversation
[11:58:51] <barmaley> play sound i saw in 2010 year when i use on Windows XP program "qip" is a client for icq
[11:59:20] <barmaley> so this is very useful, i think qtox must have this feature

[18:32:36] <sudden6> just downloaded the rust compiler
[18:33:12] <zetok> oh, right
[18:33:19] <zetok> opensuse doesn't even have it packaged
[18:33:26] <zetok> sudden6: you might want to use rustup
[18:33:34] <sudden6> it does, but only in an extra repo
[18:33:46] <sudden6> what's rustup?
[18:33:55] <zetok> program to manage multiple rust versions
[18:34:00] <zetok> +stdlib
[18:34:39] <sudden6> well I only wanr one version...
[18:34:43] <zetok> it's really useful when you want to easily compile stuff with statically linked libc
[18:36:03] <zetok> even with 1 version it still makes getting & managing the version easier when Rust is not packaged :)
[18:36:38] <sudden6> rust is packaged
[18:37:03] <zetok> also get cargo
[18:37:58] <sudden6> also installed :)
[18:43:47] <sudden6> hello world done ;)
[18:43:59] <zetok> :D
[18:52:49] <zetok> sudden6: https://github.com/qTox/blog/pull/2 ?
[18:53:45] <cisc> was wondering about the "snapiness" of the Gain slider vs. Volume slider: the Gain slider doesn't snap to as fine of a grid (almost none at all) but the Volume control slider does. anyway to make both have the same behaviour?
[18:54:23] <sudden6> zetok: is the difference somewhere where I can look at it?
[18:54:44] <zetok> hmm, lemme see
[18:56:48] <zetok> sudden6: no :s
[18:57:03] <zetok> sudden6: you could install jekyll & `jekyll serve`
[18:58:01] <zetok> basically change adds `  <meta name="keywords" content="qtox,tox,messenger,instant messaging,secure,decentralized,friendly,github,open source,voice,calling,blog">` to all pages
[18:58:49] <zetok> if page also contains `tags: ` line, it results in `  <meta name="keywords" content="qtox,tox,messenger,instant messaging,secure,decentralized,friendly,github,open source,voice,calling,blog,<content of tags>">`
[18:59:21] <sudden6> and what does it improve?
[18:59:42] <zetok> google & ddg
[18:59:47] <zetok> ^_^
[18:59:50] *** Quits: abbat (~abbat@ ) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:00:10] <zetok> it gives some keywords that search engines can associate with the pages
[19:00:23] <zetok> aside from that, change fixes the overly long URL
[19:00:36] <zetok> so it looks like `blog/2016/08/10/Hello-World.html` now
[19:01:36] <zetok> (I just copied the keywords part from the website) :D
[19:01:36] <sudden6> ok, then it makes sense :)
[19:01:44] <zetok> (and added "blog")
[19:14:07] <zetok> LGTM ?

[20:27:58] <sudden6> yep, now I have a problem getting my data into my program
[20:28:24] <zetok> ok
[20:28:38] <zetok> what is the data and from where you you want to get it?
[20:28:49] <zetok> s/you you/you/
[20:30:57] <sudden6> ha, lol it just worked™ now
[20:31:07] <sudden6> I'm not sure how and why...
[20:31:14] <zetok> :D
[20:31:19] <sudden6> can data get stuck in stdin?
[20:31:26] <zetok> oh
[20:31:36] <zetok> ~yes
[20:31:59] <zetok> but I'm kind doubtful whether you're running into buffering problem
[20:32:35] <sudden6> well, if it happens again, how can I clear stdin from bash?
[20:32:43] <zetok> um, you don't
[20:32:54] <zetok> it's not about stdin
[20:33:01] <sudden6> or am I even doing it right with cat nodes.json > myprogram ?
[20:33:09] <zetok> no
[20:33:29] <zetok> eh
[20:33:29] <sudden6> I also tried myprogram < nodes.json
[20:33:34] <zetok> that would be correct
[20:33:50] <zetok> `>` is a redirection to file
[20:34:13] <zetok> i.e. you've redirected output of `cat ..` to file named `myprogram`
[20:34:23] <sudden6> *facepalm*
[20:34:51] <sudden6> that's why it said "last_scan" : program not found...
[20:35:00] <sudden6> I'm an idiot
[20:35:44] <zetok> `|` is what you'd want to use
[20:36:11] <zetok> (assuming that you don't have a case of useless cat)
[20:37:06] <zetok> btw, the buffers problem I've mentioned earlier is not something that you can trigger with just one redirection
[20:37:38] <zetok> you'd want at least something like `foo | bar | baz` to trigger it
[20:38:30] <sudden6> mhm, I remember something about | now^^
[20:50:47] <sudden6> zetok: can your bootstrap online tester handle ipv6?
[20:53:01] <zetok> if your network supports IPv6, yes

[21:07:14] <zetok> have you tested with no other nodes online locally?
[21:07:37] <sudden6> I just spoke about my tool
[21:07:43] <zetok> oh, ok
[21:07:46] <zetok> good then :)

[22:01:21] <zetok> ew
[22:03:31] <sudden6> now that you say it, I probably mixed tabs and spaces *gasp*
[22:04:38] <zetok> using `unwrap()` isn't really that good
[22:04:58] <zetok> if you know that given code is not supposed to fail, it's better to use `expect()`
[22:05:23] <sudden6> what's the difference?
[22:05:45] <zetok> with `expect()` you get a nice message why something crashed
[22:06:23] <zetok> though, if you want something to actually work, there should be proper error handling
[22:06:32] <sudden6> also there has to be a more elegant way of doing the error handling, writing expect() 15 times in 10 lines hurt my eyes...
