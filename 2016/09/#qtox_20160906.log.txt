[20:06:07] <Chiitoo> Hi doctor ni- I mean sudden6.
[20:07:37] <zetok> given that IRC meetings didn't work out, we could try using something more asynchronous

[20:09:30] <zetok> moving discussion about the most important stuff to the ML
[20:10:17] <zetok> e.g. stuff like planned features for next releases
[20:10:42] <zetok> or rather, generally planning
[20:11:15] <sudden6> could be worth a try
[20:15:00] <Diadl0> +1
[20:15:33] <sudden6> it would also integrate antis81 more, since he's not on IRC

[21:29:53] <sudden6> zetok: updated bootrstrap nodes
[21:30:13] <zetok> sudden6: have you checked whether those nodes are online & can be used to bootstrap?
[21:30:40] <sudden6> uhm, since they are fresh from nodex.tox.chat I assumed they are working?
[21:31:00] <zetok> why would they?
[21:31:38] <zetok> anyone can add trash info there
[21:31:49] <sudden6> I don't know, I just assumed nodes.tox.chat would only provide online nodes....
[21:32:10] * zetok shrugs
[21:32:30] <sudden6> back to the drawing board then...
[21:32:46] <zetok> or you could just use my bootstrap node checker :P
[21:32:59] <sudden6> does it work on the ini format?
[21:33:04] <zetok> nope
[21:33:16] <sudden6> sigh
[21:33:25] <zetok> it works with the format provided by the tool that gets info from wiki
[21:33:35] <sudden6> this seemed so easy with a little python tool...
[21:34:09] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] sudden6 closed pull request #3693: chore(bootstrap): add script to update bootstrap nodes and update them (master...update_bootstrap) https://git.io/vinIA
[21:34:35] <zetok> btw, as for python itself – there's a slight problem with maintainability
[21:35:05] <sudden6> bigger than Rust changing every few minutes?
[21:35:22] <zetok> Rust doesn't change every few minutes
[21:35:31] <sudden6> \s
[21:36:13] <zetok> it's just that after 10+ stable releases some things were deprecated, libs got newer versions, and I might have been lazy & put `*` as a dependency version requirement, which would cause problems
[21:36:42] <zetok> if versions of deps are properly defined, it would work without problems (at worst there would be some warnings that some deprecated APIs are used)
[21:38:26] <zetok> stdlib is stable
[21:39:06] <zetok> version of library once it's released on crates.io are also immutable
[21:39:46] <zetok> (and crate submitter can't remove library version once it's uploaded to crates.io too)
[21:41:50] <zetok> tox-wiki-nodes-parser – compiled without any problems
[21:42:13] <zetok> same goes for nodes-parser-for-qtox
[21:42:57] <zetok> and what a surprise, tox-check-online-bootstraps also just works™
[21:43:21] <zetok> looks like I wasn't lazy about libs versions after all ^_^
[21:45:51] <zetok> on the other hand, I did have a problem with compiling IRC syncbot & Lee, but they depend on rstox version that seemed to have predated Rust 1.0 that stabilized stuff
[21:46:25] <zetok> (lots of APIs were removed / moved out of stdlib just before Rust 1.0 release)
[21:47:20] <zetok> sudden6: btw, if you want to Rust, lib to go with json is `rustc-serialize`
[21:47:43] <zetok> it's tad "slow", but it works
[21:48:00] <sudden6> zetok: yup, found that, but I'll do it tomorrow
[21:48:25] <zetok> the other lib for json, `serde` is made to be fast, but it still requires nightly Rust, and that tends to break
[21:49:32] <sudden6> btw, I can't seem to find info on how your programs store the data, could you explain that?
[21:49:55] <zetok> ok, which one first?
[21:50:21] <sudden6> output of tox-wiki-nodes-parser
[21:51:09] <zetok> ok
[21:53:05] <zetok> `dl_vec` downloads webpage, turns it into a `String` → `body`, then goes over the `body` splitting on newlines, and split lines are returned as vector with strings, each string containing a line from `body` → `Vec<String>`
[21:53:27] <sudden6> I'm just interested in the output format
[21:53:33] <zetok> ok
[21:54:00] <zetok> I just print (or not) each line from vector of strings if it matches a bootstrap node
[21:55:00] <zetok> (I didn't really see much point in storing that data somewhere before printing)
[21:55:12] <sudden6> won't this cause problems if some node maintainer will name his node te\nst
[21:55:16] <zetok> if line is a bootstrap → print
[21:55:31] <zetok> um?
[21:55:41] <zetok> they can name it whatever they want
[21:55:51] <sudden6> (\n being newline char)
[21:56:11] <zetok> that would result in an invalid formatting on wiki :3
[21:57:35] <zetok> (I did assume that wiki has a correct formatting)
[21:57:47] <sudden6> ok, just checked and seems to be no problem with json too
[21:58:38] <sudden6> I'm planning to replace tox-wiki-nodes-parser with a node-tox-chat parser
[21:58:57] <sudden6> which would allow to reuse the rest of your programs
[21:59:10] <sudden6> (yay unix philosophy)
[22:02:44] <zetok> <IP> <PORT> <PK> <MAINTAINER>
[22:02:50] <zetok> sudden6: ↑ that's the output format
[22:03:04] <zetok> space-delimited
[22:03:08] <sudden6> ok so just space separated values
[22:03:12] <sudden6> thx
[22:03:21] <sudden6> see you tomorrow then :)
[22:03:39] <zetok> um
[22:03:51] <zetok> kinda space-delimited
[22:04:09] <zetok> <MAINTAINER> can have as many spaces as possible
