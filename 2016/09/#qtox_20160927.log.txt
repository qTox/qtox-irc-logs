[00:10:02] <Diadlo> Neolex: Hello. One of ways: you should fork github repository (top right corner on source repo). Clone your fork on local machine, create new branch, make commits, push new branch on your fork repo. Goto your github repo page and you will see message, which will offer to create PR
[00:10:36] <Neolex> Diadlo: thank you
[00:10:49] <Diadlo> Neolex: No problem :)
[00:10:58] <Diadlo> Goodnight everyone
[00:11:04] <Neolex> Diadlo: but a made a commit on my local repository and i rebase , all of my code is erase
[00:11:11] <Neolex> how can I go back ? :s
[00:11:20] <Neolex> The commit is deleted 
[00:11:26] <Neolex> Diadlo: good night
[00:12:21] <Diadlo> Neolex: Sorry, I don't understand. You loose your commit? Or what?
[00:12:44] <Neolex> i commited on my local 
[00:12:49] <Diadlo> Yep
[00:13:18] <Neolex> but i saw i was on the master so i "reintialized" so my commit disappear but the change to the files too
[00:13:41] <Neolex> so all my changings are gone
[00:13:51] <Neolex> I have to recode them ?
[00:14:03] <Diadlo> You can restore it using reflogs
[00:14:14] <Diadlo> Or write again :)
[00:14:31] <Diadlo> `git reflog`
[00:14:34] <Neolex> Diadlo: thank you !! :D
[00:14:55] <Diadlo> Neolex: You are welcome :)
[00:15:33] <Diadlo> Neolex: So, now I can go?)
[00:15:58] <Neolex> yes :)
[00:16:00] <Neolex> good night

[05:29:47] <zetok> I see
[05:31:07] <nurupo> ><initramfs> On my system I get a maximum difference of 0.83% (using either clang or gcc). For comparison the clang binary is 1.4% smaller than the gcc binary... <-- difference in size of the binary?
[05:31:22] <initramfs> Yep
[05:31:26] <nurupo> ~1%?
[05:31:30] <initramfs> Yes
[05:31:38] <nurupo> how is that even an argument
[05:31:49] <initramfs> How is what an argument?
[05:32:18] <initramfs> That disabling RTTI is worth the size reduction?
[05:32:55] <nurupo> hm, wasn't the argument something along the lines clang > gcc because 1-2% binary size reduction?
[05:33:04] <initramfs> No no
[05:33:17] <nurupo> hm, so it's related to RTTI
[05:33:25] <initramfs> The argument was that disabling RTTI gives you 5~6% savings in binary size
[05:33:38] <initramfs> I just tested with both clang and gcc for the sake of it
[05:33:58] <initramfs> And for statistical significance, I stated that clang produces binaries 1.4% smaller than gcc
[05:34:09] <initramfs> At least on my machine, on qTox master right now
[05:36:48] <nurupo> nah, if i remember right, iphy's argument was something along the lines "thou shalt not use compiler functions thy doesn't need"
[05:37:02] <nurupo> the binary size reduction was just an extra that came with it
[05:37:17] <nurupo> not the main reason to disable rtti
[05:39:13] <initramfs> Okay
[05:42:20] <nurupo> initramfs: so, you did a gcc build with rtti, stripped it, did a gcc build without it, stripped it too, and measured the percent reduction. then repeated the same with clang, using same optimization flags. and then you noticed that clang's percent reduction is 0.83% higher than gcc's percent reduction?
[05:42:43] <initramfs> Okay, maybe I was too vague
[05:42:52] <initramfs> Both produced about 0.83% reduction
[05:43:20] <initramfs> So clang RTTI vs clang -fno-rtti = 0.83% less for -fno-rtti. The ssame results for gcc
[05:43:27] <nurupo> ok, that makes sense
[05:44:50] <nurupo> just was making sure you were comparing the percentages, not the actual sizes of reduced gcc vs clang binaries, which would be comparing apples and oranges
[05:50:48] <initramfs> Yes I know
[05:51:41] <initramfs> I mean that final statement essentially says supposingly identical flags cause a 1.4% difference between gcc and clang, so it would be stupid to compare say clang RTTI vs gcc no RTTI
[05:52:02] <initramfs> I mean it would be stupid to compare even if there was no difference... but yeah

[06:07:40] <zetok> hello Neolex
[06:08:01] <Neolex> ok my PR is very bad :s
[06:08:37] <initramfs> Naa, that's just the nature of reviewing lol
[06:09:38] <zetok> Neolex: you should read https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
[06:09:50] <Neolex> for the start port higher than the end port , the toxcore swap the value if the start port is higher than the endport
[06:10:44] <Neolex> I should redo an other PR or modify my PR ?
[06:10:58] <Neolex> I'm kinda lost with the commit form
[06:11:25] <zetok> you could modify your current PR
[06:11:38] <zetok> Neolex: what is confusing about commit message format?
[06:12:19] <Neolex> all commit have to have the commit message format , or just the last one ?
[06:12:25] <Neolex> ( sorry for my bad english )
[06:12:27] <zetok> every
[06:12:30] <initramfs> Neolex: I don't think we should rely on toxcore swapping it for us though... If one day it stopped swapping it, then we'll have tons of broken clients
[06:12:51] <zetok> initramfs: nah, that would be a bug in toxcore
[06:12:52] <Neolex> initramfs: ok yes you're right
[06:13:04] <initramfs> Well nevertheless, it's bad UI
[06:13:10] <initramfs> You confuse the user
[06:13:37] <zetok> toxcore's API is supposed to be as error-resistant as possible
[06:13:58] <Neolex> i'm really sorry to make you lose time .. ^^
[06:13:59] <initramfs> Okay, forget that then. It's still bad UI regardless
[06:14:17] <initramfs> s/forget that/forget the point about toxcore/
[06:15:38] <zetok> Neolex: um, have you looked at travis output?
[06:15:52] <Neolex> and do I have to modify the previous commit to the message format or just the new ?
[06:15:54] <Neolex> yes
[06:16:16] <zetok> https://travis-ci.org/qTox/qTox/jobs/162964197#L267 ← what does it say?
[06:16:55] <Neolex> Above ↑ commits don't conform to commit message format:
[06:18:03] <zetok> yes..?
[06:18:30] <zetok> Neolex: there are listed commits that don't conform
[06:18:44] <initramfs> Quick rundown commit format: keyword(scope): commit message
[06:18:49] <zetok> you can also check it locally
[06:19:21] <initramfs> For example, if I fixed a bug foo in the audio code, something like:
[06:19:21] <Neolex> where is the script to do it locally please ?
[06:19:26] <zetok> ./verify-commit-messages.sh master..addUDPport
[06:19:47] <initramfs> fix(audio): resolve bar to fix foo
[06:19:50] <Neolex> ah thanks
[06:21:04] <zetok> hmm
[06:21:17] <zetok> Neolex: you would want to squash those commits into a single one
[06:21:23] <zetok> first, backup your branch
[06:21:30] <zetok> `git branch backup-udp`
[06:21:48] <zetok> then use interactive rebase to squash & rename
[06:21:56] <zetok> `git rebase -i master`

[07:06:17] <Neolex> initramfs: sorry... what do you mean by "it's bad UI" ?
[07:06:51] <initramfs> Which part?
[07:07:27] <initramfs> The port start/end ordering thing?
[07:08:40] <Neolex> yes
[07:14:05] <Neolex> i should use signal and slot maybe ?
[07:14:48] <Neolex> or I dont have to verify because it's swap if the end port is greater than the start port ?
[07:16:11] <initramfs> Well, what I meant by that is you get bad UX
[07:16:28] <initramfs> Imagine a user who doesn't know toxcore reorders the start/end
[07:16:54] <initramfs> If you put in a bad start/end port combination by mistake, and qTox accepts it fine, you get confused
[07:17:23] <initramfs> You don't know if it's actually working (it swapped it) or it simply disabled it or something else
[07:18:04] <initramfs> Essentially you're programming the UI to do behavior that's non-intuitive and possibly ambiguous.
[07:18:44] <Neolex> ok thank you initramfs
[07:19:12] <initramfs> There are several ways you can choose to fix it. Either warn the users that their input is bad, or actually change the values in the spinners so it's flipped (so users can see qTox actually flipped them), or give some visual "bad input" feedback

[07:25:43] <zetok> or perhaps a dialog that would ask to swap values would be better

[07:30:07] <initramfs> Yeah
[07:30:17] <initramfs> If the input is valid, just leave it alone
[07:30:17] <Neolex> ok thank you

[16:34:13] <zetok> >git checkout new_udp
[16:34:19] <zetok> ↑ unnecessary
[16:34:37] <zetok> anyway, with that you'll have stuff restored

[16:39:27] <zetok> Neolex: do you have `qtox` upstream added?
[16:39:46] <Neolex> i don't understand :/
[16:39:50] <zetok> git remote add upstream https://github.com/qTox/qTox.git
[16:40:01] <Neolex> ok
[16:40:10] <zetok> git branch -D master && git fetch upstream master:master
[16:40:30] <Neolex> ok
[16:40:41] <zetok> git branch -D udp_new && git checkout master -b udp_new

[16:41:21] <zetok> hm?
[16:41:21] <Neolex> branch udp_new not found 
[16:41:28] <Neolex> i think the branch is new_udp 
[16:41:32] <Neolex> or its a new ?
[16:41:44] <zetok> oh, right
[16:41:58] <Neolex> neolex@neolex-pc> src$git branch -D new_udp && git checkout master -b new_udp
[16:41:59] <Neolex> Branche new_udp supprimée (précédemment 1f45785).
[16:42:01] <Neolex> Basculement sur la nouvelle branche 'new_udp'

[16:43:07] <Neolex> great
[16:43:15] <zetok> now there should be 2 commits
[16:43:23] <Neolex> yes !
[16:43:26] <Neolex> git commit -a --amend.   now ?
[16:43:29] <zetok> no
[16:43:32] <Neolex> ok
[16:43:37] <zetok> since you have 2 commits, you need to squash
[16:43:43] <Neolex> git rebase -i ?
[16:43:49] <zetok> git rebase -i upstream/master
[16:43:58] <zetok> oh wait
[16:44:12] <zetok> just `git rebase -i master`
[16:44:30] <Neolex> and i change the second pick to squash ?
[16:44:40] <zetok> yep
[16:44:49] <zetok> (IIRC)
[16:44:59] <Neolex> ? IIRC ?
[16:45:05] <zetok> if I remember correctly
[16:45:21] <Neolex> whats iirc ?
[16:45:29] <zetok> above ↑ :)
[16:46:21] <Neolex> sorry I dont understand
[16:46:33] <zetok> IIRC – if I remember correctly
[16:46:36] <zetok> anyway
[16:46:43] <Neolex> aah
[16:46:52] <Neolex> ok lol sorry
[16:47:00] <zetok> squashed?
[16:47:17] <Neolex> now i have the 2 validation message
[16:47:33] <Neolex> i comment the "add space tooltips" etc ?
[16:47:54] <zetok> you don't need the "add space tooltips" part
[16:48:29] <zetok> e.g. https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3744
[16:48:30] <Neolex> http://pastebin.com/EkiUxNWC
[16:48:37] <Neolex> i delete the second message no ?
[16:48:51] <zetok> yep
[16:49:15] <Neolex> great
[16:49:18] <Neolex> i think thats ok
[16:50:32] <Neolex> I have to push now ?
[16:51:00] <zetok> git branch -D udp_port && git checkout -b udp_port
[16:51:05] <Neolex> but I have to on the udp_port branch no ? the pull request si for that branch ?
[16:51:09] <Neolex> ok
[16:51:10] <zetok> git push -u origin udp_port -f
[16:51:10] <Neolex> thank you
[16:51:48] <Neolex> thanks
[16:52:13] <zetok> np
[16:52:23] <Neolex> I'll be right back
[16:53:04] <zetok> and now, if there are any changes to be made: 1. make sure that you have a backup branch; 2. you can "squash" latest commit with `git commit -a --amend`
[17:26:54] <Neolex> zetok: ok thank you
[17:27:45] <Neolex> zetok: and how do I create a backup branch ? git branch back_up && git checkout back_up && git push backup ?
[17:28:21] <Neolex> zetok: do you have a link of a good course/tuto/book on git ? 
[17:28:30] <zetok> Neolex: ~yep, but you don't need to checkout it
[17:28:40] <Neolex> ok thank's !
[17:28:48] <zetok> I don't really
[17:29:03] <zetok> I mean, you got most of basic stuff down
[17:29:14] <zetok> btw, use `git fetch` instead of `git pull`
[17:29:20] <Neolex> ah
[17:29:22] <Neolex> ok thank
[17:29:27] <Neolex> i'll search the difference
[17:29:54] <zetok> um, you might be interested in reading git manpages
[17:30:01] <Neolex> pull = fetch + merge ?
[17:30:06] <zetok> ~yep
[17:30:19] <zetok> although pull's behaviour can be changed
[17:30:31] <Neolex> ah yes i forgot the man pages , i'll read it right now
[17:30:45] <Neolex> and I'm very sorry for the time you're losing with me 
[17:31:33] <zetok> no problem :)

[18:31:14] <matti> If I try to call, the call button turns red and neither party can hear anything. If the other party calls me, I can hear the ring tone but upon accepting the call, the call button is red and neither one of us can hear anything. any other sound requiring app works with the sound. Any ideas at all?
