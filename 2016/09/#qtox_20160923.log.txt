[21:36:47] <sudden6> which ones? some ready to merge fall under the 24h rule
[21:37:42] <sudden6> and on https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3717 I thought you'll merge directly after LGTM, but I think I should have written that
[21:39:10] <zetok> I didn't merge it, since I really think that I shouldn't merge that I don't actually understand
[21:39:42] *** Joins: sudd3n6 (~anonymous@ )
[21:40:01] <sudden6> Hmm, I think it should suffice to have LGTM for the part you don't understand
[21:41:11] *** Joins: f10 (~flo@ )
[21:41:38] <sudden6> because, in my opinion giving a LGTM equals merging it myself, with the added benefit that others can finish their discussions and merge if they are fine with it
[21:43:52] <zetok> ok
[21:48:58] <sudden6>  zetok: for emoticons, do you know of a standardized directory for them?
[21:49:15] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] zetok closed pull request #3717: Fix problem with disappearing short RTL text in chatform (master...fixArabicText) https://git.io/viVG5
[21:49:29] <sudden6> or should we just use $XDG_DATA_DIR/qtox/emoticons ?
[21:51:51] <zetok> standard is /usr/share/emoticons/
[21:52:34] <sudden6> yeah, but we need a user writeable directory
[21:53:15] <zetok> `$XDG_DATA_DIR/emoticons/
[21:53:19] <zetok> `
[21:53:48] <zetok> note though that
[21:53:56] <zetok> >$XDG_DATA_HOME is either not set or empty, a default equal to $HOME/.local/share should be used.
[21:54:37] <sudden6> that would be a user issue I think, I only want to load files from there
[21:54:58] <sudden6> hmm, actually it's our issue
[21:58:57] <zetok> rerumnovarum: includes; there should be no relative includes, right?
[21:59:07] <zetok> …
[21:59:27] <zetok> ↑ hexchat bug :f
[21:59:51] * zetok wrote `re: includes;`
[22:00:28] <zetok> rerumnovarum: sorry, looks like hexchat doesn't like your nick :(
[22:01:04] <sudden6> zetok: I think https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qstandardpaths.html GenericDataLocation + emoticons subdirectory would be optimal
[22:01:54] <sudden6> zetok: yes, I think that was the consensus
[22:02:07] <zetok> ok, that part is missing in the PR
[22:03:57] <sudden6> hm? I think that's covered by "include files starting with the root directory of the"
[22:04:26] <zetok> ~yep
[22:05:27] <zetok> hmm, perhaps it's fine if explicit mention that relative paths are to not be used, but IMO currently it's not really clear
[22:05:47] <zetok> s/used/used is missing/
[22:06:22] <sudden6> mhm, maximum clearance (lol) is not bad on guidelines
[22:06:24] <zetok> i.e. it sounds like an example of what should be, without specifying that something else shouldn't be used
[22:07:02] <sudden6> could you comment? I'll redo the emoticons stuff today and don't want to forget
[22:07:05] *** Quits: sudd3n6 (~anonymous@ ) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[22:07:06] <zetok> ok
[22:07:36] <sudden6> my ultimate goal is to not compile emoticons into qtox anymore for non standalone builds
[22:10:18] <zetok> sounds good :)
[22:10:27] <Chiitoo> No emoticons sounds nice indeed.
