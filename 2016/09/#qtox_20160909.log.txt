[14:03:57] <C0rn3j> I'm done, despite doing a wipe of everything my Telegram acc keeps getting compromised. Anyone has info about Antox?  Because afaik it doesn't support groups and that's the only reason I can't fully switch
[14:04:15] *** Joins: in1t3r (~LordShiva@ )
[14:08:34] <Emcy> compromised how
[14:09:18] <C0rn3j> Someone from Iran keeps logging into my account.
[14:09:53] <Emcy> lol
[14:10:21] <C0rn3j> I've literally deleted whole internal memory of my phone and flashed newest nightly CM and did a clean Arch Linux install on both my computers. Still got compromised again.
[14:11:31] <Emcy> antox hasnt updated in a while
[14:15:32] <C0rn3j> Sadly it looks to be the only android client apart from uTox, which I believe dropped support so I didn't even try that.
[14:16:42] <Emcy> the iphone client is great
[14:17:00] <Emcy> antox went thru like 3 maintainers cos of drama
[14:17:03] <Emcy> a real shame
[14:17:24] <C0rn3j> Sadly I'm not a fan of Apple products
[14:18:29] <Emcy> the problem is toxcore is being forked and everyone is thinking about that
[14:20:13] <C0rn3j> Ughhh
[14:26:12] <C0rn3j> What other cross platform and secure options do I have, apart from IRC?
[14:27:08] <Emcy> nothing
[14:28:01] <Emcy> telegram was never secure
[14:29:38] <zetok> hmm
[14:31:19] <zetok> C0rn3j: nothing that would have groupchats
[14:31:46] <zetok> Emcy: toxcore being forked in *not* a problem
[14:32:09] <zetok> C0rn3j: also, I wouldn't consider IRC secure either
[14:32:28] <Emcy> its a turn of phrase you autist

[14:48:48] <C0rn3j> zetok: How is IRC insecure?
[14:49:08] <zetok> by design
[14:50:49] <Emcy> the only way it could even begin to be secure is if you hosted your own server with a self signed cert you have a prior record of the fingerprint of
[14:51:02] <Emcy> and only let your freinds on it and no random rabble
[14:51:27] <Emcy> and ofc disallowed non tls connections
[14:51:42] <Emcy> and even then tls uses NIST crypto so
[14:52:09] <Emcy> and by host i mean in your house where you can keep an eye on it
[14:52:24] <Emcy> i think then it would approch the security of a private tox group
[15:07:11] <C0rn3j> Yeah I have no problems with self hosted solutions, I'll do that.
[15:07:15] <C0rn3j> Thanks
[15:07:37] *** Quits: pcre (~quassel@ ) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[15:09:16] <C0rn3j> I'll probably just get a LE cert instead of self signed, but eh, still better than TG.
[15:14:34] <Emcy> if that suits your needs
[15:14:49] <Emcy> its a pity new GC got stalled
[15:15:13] <Emcy> they used to crow about deprecating irc with it
