[18:43:00] <initramfs> zetok: Regarding issue #3460, I prefer having the setup files have different names "e.g. setup-qtox.exe and "setup-qtox64.exe" just for the sake of clarity. Though I really don't have a convincing argument for it.

[18:45:21] <Andrew7> Isn't it possible to have an MSI installer with both 64-bit and 32-bit executables?
[18:45:24] <zetok> initramfs: right, could you comment about it on the issue?
[18:45:48] <zetok> no, it's not possible to have a *msi* installer
[18:46:16] <initramfs> zetok: Sure
[18:46:35] <zetok> Andrew7: unless someone has made a FOSS tool for it that works under Linux?
[18:46:45] <zetok> initramfs: thanks :)
[18:47:13] <Andrew7> zetok: Does Wix run on Linux? I've only used it a little.
[18:49:27] <zetok> doesn't seem so
[18:49:37] <Andrew7> Ah ok.
[19:02:24] <zetok> could someone review the PR?
