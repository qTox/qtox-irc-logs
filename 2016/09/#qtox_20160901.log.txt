[21:53:27] <qTox-syncbot> Zetok\0: none that I know of
[21:54:05] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: I think, we should select one of the existing style
[21:54:29] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: I see no reason to create another
[21:56:35] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: LLVM and Mozilla use 2 space indent. IMHO, it's too small
[21:59:54] <sudden6> At first glance I like the WebKit one the most
[22:00:01] <initramfs> Zetok, Diadlo: I've already created a clang-format style with some additional rules, right now I'm writing a new CODE_FORMATTING.md file which goes in depth of how to format code.
[22:00:35] <sudden6> can a lgtm on reviewable override unresolved discussions?
[22:00:47] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: initramfs: Why you create another one code style?
[22:01:23] <qTox-syncbot> Amit Agnani: I created a coding style based on the existing established rules of qTox
[22:01:52] <zetok> sudden6: ~yep
[22:02:05] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: IMO, better will be change current coding style on the one of existing
[22:02:17] <sudden6> Is there something as a QT or KDE coding style?
[22:02:29] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: sudden6, Zetok: What you think ^ ?
[22:02:43] <qTox-syncbot> Zetok\0: dunno, I haven't looked much into that
[22:03:13] <sudden6> IMHO, if something like that exist we should use it, since qt and qtox are very close^^
[22:03:15] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: Zetok: Oh... I forget about it
[22:03:30] <sudden6> zetok: how exactly ~yep?
[22:04:18] <zetok> sudden6: I think that it always overrides, but I'm not 100% sure about that
[22:05:16] <sudden6> ok, I will ask antis81 to clear up his then anyway :)

[22:06:11] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: https://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Frameworks_Coding_Style
[22:09:14] <sudden6> seems like kde style is basically indentical to qt style
[22:10:09] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: Seems yes
[22:10:29] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: Noope :)
[22:10:39] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: KDE: Use curly braces even when the body of a conditional statement contains only one line. 
[22:10:49] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: Qt: Use curly braces only when the body of a conditional statement contains more than one line: 
[22:11:09] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: I prefer KDE's one
[22:11:17] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: // In this case
[22:12:01] <qTox-syncbot> Amit Agnani: Just keep in mind, that means the entire codebase will need to be reformatted
[22:12:23] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: Yes. I know
[22:12:33] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: But only once
[22:14:13] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: From KDE: 
[22:14:15] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: > You can use astyle (>=1.23) to format code or to test if you have followed this document.
[22:15:03] <sudden6> to be honest, I like our current style the most, because it puts { on it's own line, else we are pretty close to qt I think
[22:17:51] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: I do not like `{` on new line :)
[22:18:07] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: IMHO
[22:19:05] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: Seems, `astyle` are really easy to use)
[22:21:03] <qTox-syncbot> Amit Agnani: Ah, the age-old, { debate.
[22:21:33] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: No debate :) I agree save old { rule
[22:22:15] <qTox-syncbot> Amit Agnani: And tsk tsk you people, you wait until AFTER I write the clang format file to discuss it? Tsk tsk tsk
[22:22:39] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: :)
[22:22:43] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: Sorry
[22:23:04] <sudden6> sorry ^^

[22:26:15] <qTox-syncbot> Amit Agnani: > [05:23:49] Diadlo: Amit Agnani, sudden6: Have you try it? |\n|  |\n| Same here, I've only researched clang-format so far.
[22:26:42] <sudden6> I'm leaving for the night, bye :)
[22:26:51] <qTox-syncbot> Amit Agnani: Bye
[22:26:55] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: Amit Agnani: Ok. Then I think it makes sense to continue research :)
[22:27:01] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: sudden6: Bye :)
[22:27:09] <qTox-syncbot> Amit Agnani: Diadlo: Sure
[22:27:49] <qTox-syncbot> Diadlo: I think I also have to go. Good night everyone
[22:28:03] <qTox-syncbot> Amit Agnani: Good bye
[22:28:05] <qTox-syncbot> Zetok\0: g'night :)
[22:45:53] <zetok> would squashing commits for https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3442 be good?
[22:47:11] <oranges> always squash commits
[22:47:36] <zetok> well
[22:47:58] <zetok> tux3 didn't seem to like when commits in PR were squashed :s
[22:48:15] *** Quits: sudden6 (~anonymous@ ) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[22:48:26] <zetok> oh well
[22:48:27] <oranges> tux3 is obviously damaged
[22:49:28] <zetok> b-but like 20 commits per 200 lines changed sounds just right
[22:57:08] <initramfs> Yeah.... That should probably be squashed...
[23:29:25] *** Quits: initramfs (~initramfs@ ) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:50:07] *** Joins: initramfs (~initramfs@ )
[23:52:09] <iphy> I think one commit should be one logical and consistent change
[23:52:24] <iphy> So if you revert that commit, the change is undone
[23:52:45] <iphy> If you need to revert 20 commits to undo a change, it's probably wrong
[23:53:24] <iphy> Regarding coding style, I agree that it should be close to Qt style
[23:53:44] <iphy> I don't think it's useful to obsess over it
[23:54:03] <iphy> Open source projects like to obsess over precise rules
[23:54:26] <iphy> In reality, you want a consistent enforceable style, and what style it is doesn't really matter
[23:55:21] <iphy> People who think they've eaten from the tree of wisdom and have been elected by God personally to preach the one and only coding style are going to have a bad time in life
