[18:52:07] <cisc> as soon as you go out of the Audio/Video tab, the slider is back down to 0

[18:56:54] <iphy> webcam doesn't work for me either, on osx
[18:57:35] <cisc> it worked about a month ago, I could preview the device when in the Audio/Video Tab. Now on Tumbleweed with the OBS package, only the Mic on the webcam works, no video
[18:58:19] <iphy> thoughts on renaming toxcore to c-toxcore?
[18:58:39] <iphy> so that we make room for other language implementations of toxcore
[18:59:09] <cisc> either that or toxcore-c
[19:01:14] <iphy> so there are two things you can do with foreign languages: either make a language binding to $lib, or rewrite $lib in language
[19:01:33] <iphy> when you do the second thing, you can then also export a C API *from* that language again
[19:01:38] <iphy> so you can go full circle
[19:01:49] <iphy> what names should each of these things have?
[19:02:46] <iphy> e.g.: c-toxcore-c is the C implementation of toxcore backed by C, hs-toxcore-c the haskell binding to a toxcore-c implementation, hs-toxcore-hs a pure haskell implementation with a haskell api, and c-toxcore-hs a C binding to the haskell implementation
[19:02:56] <iphy> other ideas?
[19:05:24] <iphy> so it's like $api_lang-$lib-$impl_lang
[19:06:11] <iphy> theoretically you could do hs-toxcore-py, that would be haskell bindings to py-toxcore-*
[19:06:31] <iphy> ah, and hs-toxcore-c would be a binding to a c-toxcore implementation, not a toxcore-c implementation
[19:06:47] <iphy> anything exporting a C API would be named c-toxcore-$impl_lang
[19:07:02] <iphy> zetok: thoughts?
[19:10:13] <zetok> looks ugly
[19:10:59] <iphy> alternatives?
[19:11:35] <zetok> toxcore-$lang
[19:11:59] <iphy> what does it mean?
[19:12:37] <zetok> IMO there's no real need to explicitly say whether implementation in given language exposes C API
[19:13:03] <zetok> rather, explicitly say in implementation name
[19:13:17] <iphy> the thing is, hstox for instance will not expose a C API itself
[19:13:30] <iphy> I found that it's going to be too much code in a single library
[19:13:55] <zetok> still fine IMO to call it toxcore-h{askell,s}
[19:14:12] <iphy> instead, there will be hstox (hs-toxcore-hs in the above schema), and a separate library named something else that binds to it and exposes a C API
[19:14:26] <zetok> eh
[19:14:27] <iphy> ok, so toxcore-hs would be what?
[19:14:41] <zetok> haskell implementation with haskell-only bindings
[19:14:52] <iphy> ok, what's the name of the C API based on it?
[19:14:59] <zetok> toxcore-capi
[19:15:02] <iphy> and by bindings I assume you mean API
[19:15:14] <zetok> if you really want to put a lang name there, toxcore-capi-hs
[19:15:16] <iphy> ok, but toxcore-capi is for haskell? what about the rust one?
[19:15:19] <iphy> aha, ok
[19:15:47] <iphy> so you propose: $lib-${api_lang}api-$impl_lang
[19:16:34] <zetok> I think that `toxcore-capi` is a fine name for all languages
[19:16:52] <iphy> so a single repo with all the languages in it?
[19:16:56] <zetok> no
[19:17:02] <zetok> just the same name for all languages
[19:17:08] <iphy> I'm talking about repo names by the way
[19:17:16] <iphy> library/package names are language-specific
[19:17:29] <zetok> mm
[19:17:44] <zetok> I see the benefits of what you're proposing
[19:18:47] <zetok> I'm just wondering how realistic it will be to have bindings from implementation in $lang, written in that $lang for languages other than C
[19:21:34] <zetok> if that can be excluded, proposed naming would be `$lib-capi-$impl_lang`
[19:24:13] <zetok> if that's an actual thing, then proposed by you naming scheme might be better
[19:24:42] <zetok> it's just that right after reading your explanation for it I've managed to forget what part means what
[19:24:53] <zetok> twice by now
[19:25:29] <iphy> The mnemonic is that if you put two of them next to each other, the names need to match
[19:26:02] <iphy> *-toxcore-c binds to c-toxcore-*
[19:26:45] <zetok> oh, nice

[23:06:45] <iphy> zetok: $api_lang-$lib if it's not a binding
[23:07:31] <iphy> so, c-toxcore, hs-toxcore, rs-toxcore are all native toxcore implementations that aren't backed by another api they bind to
[23:07:55] <iphy> anything with -$lang at the end is binding to an api in $lang
[23:08:20] <iphy> so jvm-toxcore-c is the jvm binding for the C API of toxcore
[23:08:40] <iphy> hs-toxcore is a native haskell implementation, hs-toxcore-c is the haskell C binding
[23:09:50] <iphy> i.e. if there is no -$lang at the end, then the chain terminates there
