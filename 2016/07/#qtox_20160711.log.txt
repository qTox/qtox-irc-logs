[10:23:42] <Saaaam> zetok: indeed, the removed flags were the ones unused yet. I plan to add the other current unused flags as soon as they will be renamed properly.
[10:23:48] <Saaaam> I'm doing the change

[15:20:31] <Saaaam> hey
[15:35:24] *** Joins: reBrain (~reBrain@ )
[15:42:06] <zetok> Saaaam: um, could you re-add flags names?
[15:42:22] <zetok> i.e. all the flags, but with proper zend locale name
[15:42:54] <zetok> Saaaam: btw, if you could use CLI git you could restore stuff / commit, etc a lot easier
[15:44:07] <Saaaam> zetok: yep, I plan to do all the flags indeed ;)  It gonna take some days (as I'm gonna move a lot this week), but I want to achieve that.
[15:44:45] <Saaaam> What does CLI stands for?
[15:44:57] <zetok> command line interface

[15:47:14] <Saaaam> Well, I installed git days ago. And I did have a CLI. But apparently, I couldn't manage to unify my local changes to my github account :/
[15:47:20] <Saaaam> *noob here* :x
[15:49:52] <zetok> do you have your remote (github) repo added locally?
[15:50:15] <zetok> `git remote -v`
[15:55:17] <Saaaam> Yeah, thanks to the GitHub Desktop https://desktop.github.com/

[22:46:39] <linuxmodder> in multi window shift+tab *might* work like it does in some irc clients
