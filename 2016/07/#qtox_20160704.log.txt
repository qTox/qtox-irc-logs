[08:18:46] <anoa> o
[08:33:19] <anoa> Is there a reason toxcore is sending two signals of a friend status changing when they go away/online?
[08:36:57] <anoa> Also how do we tell which arguments toxcore methods provide when Qt 'connect'ing them?
[08:41:58] <anoa> Is there a toxcore API spec?
[08:42:51] <zetok> about the first, `Online` in toxcore is used to for both friend actually becoming online, and for their status – first toxcore receives packet from friend, so it "knows" that friend is online → status callback "Online", and short time after that toxcore receives info from friend that their status is "Away", and sends callback about that
[08:42:58] <zetok> dunno about the second
[08:43:40] <zetok> >Is there a toxcore API spec?
[08:43:55] <zetok> there is spec of protocol, and there are API docs
[08:44:52] <zetok> anoa: https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/blob/master/toxcore/tox.h ← API, also toxav.h in toxav dir
[08:45:26] <anoa> Thank you zetok, running through core.h I was able to find the necessary arguments, but the information about Online vs Away and other status is interesting.
[08:48:53] <zetok> you're welcome :)

[10:32:13] <minor> Hello after all instructions via the link: https://tox.chat/download.html#gnulinux I got: Unable to locate package qtox
[10:34:29] <minor> Where I can find stable version qtox for Ubuntu 14.04 ?
[10:35:31] <ovalseven8_> minor: https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Aantonbatenev%3Atox&package=qtox
[10:36:13] <ovalseven8_> abbat, Do you update your packages every day or after every commit or does your repository only include stable releases?
[10:42:11] <minor> This release (https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Aantonbatenev%3Atox&package=qtox) does not work the keyboard switch
[10:42:44] <ovalseven8_> It's probably because it's the stable release and this doesn't include some changes yet
[10:43:01] <ovalseven8_> Unless you want to test qTox, it's definitely recommended to use the stable releases
[10:43:30] <abbat> ovalseven8_, I update packages when I have free time (2-3 per week).
[10:44:00] <ovalseven8_> abbat, Oh, I see. But wouldn't it make sense only to use the stable releases for qTox?
[10:45:45] <abbat> ovalseven8_, I can create qtox-stable package if someone wants it, but it will be too old from upstream.
[10:46:30] <ovalseven8_> abbat, Thing is that the stable releases have been created for the reason to provide releases with less bugs for the users
[10:46:58] <abbat> ovalseven8_, Ok, would you create issue and assign it to me?
[10:47:42] <ovalseven8_> I am not sure what's tux3's position here, however. But it would make sense to provide stable releases for the normal users.
[10:47:51] <ovalseven8_> I guess the Windows releases are all stable too

[11:11:27] <ovalseven8_> zetok, eh
[11:22:51] <ovalseven8_> zetok, Come on. You know what I mean
[11:23:11] <zetok> yes, I'm merely pointing out that your idea is wrong
[11:23:30] <zetok> not entirely, but a substantial portion of it
[11:23:32] <ovalseven8_> Then just say it!
[11:23:51] <zetok> um.
[11:24:09] <ovalseven8_> It's just waste of time to talk around something
[11:25:20] <zetok> Thing is, this is my opinion, which is based on my knowledge – since I don't know everything, I don't have 100% certainty that my opinion is right, thus I'm simply asking questions to determine whether I'm right, and if I'm not, to get the knowledge about stuff I don't know.
[11:25:59] <zetok> Who knows, perhaps there are good reasons to abandon providing for users newest qTox, and if so, I'd be interested in hearing about them.
[11:26:25] <ovalseven8_> There is a reason why stable releases has been created, no?
[11:26:39] <zetok> that's not the point I'm asking about
[11:26:54] <zetok> I'm asking why should latest builds be abandoned?
[11:27:08] <zetok> because this is the part of idea that seems wrong
[11:27:45] <ovalseven8_> What? Normal users should use stable releases and devs and people who would like to test should use the packages abbar already provides
[11:28:41] <zetok> oh, looks like I misunderstood – it sounded like you were proposing replacing latest packages with stable
[11:30:56] <zetok> as for part about switching default to stable – might be a good idea starting from the next release, dunno

[11:33:35] <abbat> so we need naming decision, "qtox-stable" package name for stable release and "qtox" for upstream, or "qtox" for stable and "?" for upstream?
[11:34:25] <ovalseven8_> "qtox" for stable and "qtox-nightly" for upstream?
[11:36:00] <ovalseven8_> zetok, qTox for Windows and MacOS also use only the stable releases, right?
[11:37:34] <zetok> >qTox for Windows and MacOS also use only the stable releases, right?
[11:37:35] <zetok> yes
[11:37:48] <zetok> >"qtox" for stable and "qtox-nightly" for upstream?
[11:38:09] <zetok> if it starts from next stable release, why not

[11:39:03] <zetok> when video gets fixed :s
[11:39:43] <ovalseven8_> As already pointed out, it would make sense to completely rewrite A/V. It's such a mess - but, of course, it takes time and tux3 is busy it seems
[11:39:56] <zetok> https://github.com/tux3/qTox/pull/3185 ← mostly this PR, it needs to be fixed
[11:40:20] <zetok> i.e. there's only 1 thing remaining in PR to fix, but.. :(
[11:40:41] <zetok> aside from video, some other PRs that are ready or could be ready
[11:40:57] <zetok> e.g. https://github.com/tux3/qTox/pull/3423
[11:41:15] <zetok> abbat: ↑ could you make needed change when you will have time?

[15:36:26] <zetok> ovalseven8_: what do you suggest doing about that?
[15:36:28] <ovalseven8_> zetok, abbat: What do you think about that the "qtox-nightly" should be debug builds by default because they are especially for devs and testers?
[15:36:41] <zetok> phd21: um?
[15:36:47] <ovalseven8_> zetok, I don't have a Weblate account and don't really want to register there
[15:37:02] <phd21> "qTox" was not in the repos when I first installed it
[15:37:24] <phd21> Are you saying that "qTox is now in the Linux Mint repos?
[15:38:07] <zetok> phd21: "tox" may sound like "talks" in English
[15:38:22] <zetok> phd21: there's a repo that should work with your distro
[15:38:35] <abbat> ovalseven8_, Not debug build, but has debug symbols in separate file.

[15:39:06] <zetok> phd21: https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Aantonbatenev%3Atox&package=qtox
[15:39:48] <zetok> ovalseven8_: ok, but how "bad" is the translation? i.e. completely wrong, or just not as good as it could be?
[15:40:05] <ovalseven8_> Not as good as it could be, but understandable
[15:40:55] <zetok> ok, so there's no need to discard it, right?
[15:41:01] <phd21> zetok: I was using the nightly build using the terminal instructions, and it was working. But another mint user said that ".deb" files were available, so I decided to try that, and that is when I go the chat log errors...
[15:41:11] <phd21> So, just remove it and re-install it?

[15:46:27] <phd21> zetok: Is using the terminal install instructions better than using the .deb? On my KDE, the terminal did not create menu items, but the deb file did. I was using v1.3 even though getting nightly updates, perhaps my desktop link to /bin/qtox was not updated properly, but when I used the deb, I am now on v1.4
[15:47:22] <zetok> phd21: thing is, installing just .deb won't get you all needed dependencies, due to what your qTox install can't open history
[15:47:53] <zetok> also, the desktop entry should be provided when you install qTox from OBS repo
[15:48:54] <zetok> desktop entry – menu item
[15:49:31] *** Joins: minor (~mono@ )
[15:49:33] <phd21> zetok: ok, thank you. one more question. I used to see a video option for desktop, but now I do not. i was wondering if that helped with users that did not have a actual video source to still receive a video call without qtox crashing?
[15:49:59] <zetok> abbat: ↑ ?
[15:50:53] <koshii> Are qtox updates going to continue being available through the debian repo pkg.tox.chat/debian ?
[15:51:13] <koshii> I've heard that qtox is going to "break off" a bit from the rest of the tox world, I didn't really know what that meant, if it meant anything at all...
[15:51:51] <zetok> koshii: it means that packages from tox.chat aren't really supported
[15:52:10] <koshii> zetok: OK, what repo should I be using for qtox instead?

[15:54:25] <koshii> fred_barclay: Thanks. And this is the "official" one now, the tox.chat repo will no longer be updated with qtox, correct?
[15:54:49] <fred_barclay> koshii: I'm not a qtox dev so I wouldn't be the person to answer that. ;)
[15:56:08] <zetok> koshii: eh, it should be deprecated as of now
[15:56:46] <koshii> zetok: OK thanks for the clarity
[15:56:52] <zetok> deprecated – users are suggested to move to the new repo
[15:58:39] <fred_barclay> zetok: the tox.chat is deprecated or the one I linked above?
[15:58:51] <zetok> fred_barclay: tox.chat
[15:59:07] <zetok> only for Linux though
[15:59:23] <koshii> zetok: But *only* users of qtox right? Not utox (which I don't think is even in the repo), or toxic?
[15:59:40] <fred_barclay> zetok: phew. Okay. You linked me to the OBS one on GitHub for an issue I had so I've been using that one. :)
[15:59:56] <zetok> koshii: yep
[16:00:41] <koshii> zetok: Any chance for an official debian packaging sometime?
[16:01:32] <zetok> fred_barclay: good to hear that it works for you :)
[16:01:39] <zetok> koshii: no, that would be bad
[16:01:55] <koshii> zetok: Oh really, and why would it be "bad" ?
[16:02:27] <koshii> Seems rather "damn good" from a user experience PoV
[16:02:46] <zetok> being stuck for years on buggy/broken version?
[16:03:01] <koshii> contrib, backports?
[16:03:11] <zetok> do people even use that?
[16:03:15] <koshii> Of course
[16:03:18] <zetok> also, you're asking about stable
[16:03:26] <koshii> And anyway, you wouldn't be allowed to be stuck for years on a buggy/broken version :)
[16:03:35] <zetok> what.
[16:03:56] <zetok> being stuck for years on buggy/broken version is precisely how debian stable works.
[16:04:08] <koshii> The intention is the opposite.
[16:04:17] <zetok> intention ≠ reality
[16:04:19] <koshii> Maybe being *stuck* on a version for a while indeed, but they do have some quality standards
[16:04:27] <zetok> also, that's not the intention of debian stable
[16:04:46] <koshii> I'm pretty sure it is.
[16:04:50] <zetok> the intention is "stuck with bugs for years, in order to be stable"
[16:05:15] <koshii> That's not how it looks from the perspective of the issue tracker, but your cynicism about it is duly noted :)
[16:05:29] <zetok> again, that's the reality
[16:05:54] <koshii> I'm a Debian user for 10 years I guess; it hasn't been my experience.

[16:09:55] <koshii> (Jessie)
[16:10:03] <zetok> quite contrary to what I've seen a few days ago
[16:10:12] <koshii> mpv-0.6.2-2
[16:10:24] <koshii> *shrug* 
[16:10:46] *** Joins: f10 (~flo@ )
[16:10:57] <zetok> yeah, would seem that the same version didn't work to play stuff from yt
[16:11:04] *** Joins: isAAAc (~isAAAc@ )
[16:11:40] <koshii> Just did it and it works, 100%.

[16:12:42] <zetok> I'm wondering how's that possible, given that (IIRC) the version debian is using doesn't even support current yt
[16:14:31] <koshii> zetok: I always do the 'apt-get -t jessie-backports upgrade' so totally possible that there was some patch in a backport.

[16:37:35] <ovalseven8_> zetok, Done
[16:39:35] <koshii> fred_barclay: Well however it got on there, it was through a debian repo. And 0.6.2-2 definitely has yt support, since I just tried it :)

[16:45:33] <zetok> ovalseven8_: thanks
[17:00:31] <ovalseven8_> zetok, Is it normal that the fonts are only updated for new communication?
[17:00:42] <zetok> yep
[17:00:56] <zetok> just restart qTox if you want consistency
[17:02:22] <ovalseven8_> zetok, I see. In case it's not changeable (immediate font change would be cool) we should probably add a popup that asks if you would like to restart
[17:03:22] <zetok> ovalseven8_: not sure if that's needed, but.. mind making an issue? :)

[18:15:42] <koshii> It looks like the same one #ipfs is using? Is it?
[18:17:22] <zetok> it's provided by github

[19:54:16] <zetok> weird stuff, after unplugging my webcam on Gentoo & starting qTox I still have valid `Desktop` "camera", but on a compiled one on other distro it doesn't seem to work :/
[19:54:29] <zetok> perhaps I'd need to restart Gentoo

[20:48:18] <genesis> < gentoo
[20:52:37] <ovalseven8_> I was just thinking about which programming language and GUI framework would be ideal for a Tox client. And C++ is actually one of the good choices. Bad state of things.
[20:53:03] <ovalseven8_> Of course, I mean for cross-platform things

[21:33:43] <zetok> ovalseven8_: once there will be a good GUI toolkit, Rust
[21:34:07] <ovalseven8_> zetok, I knew that you would say this. But personally I think Rust is also too low-level
[21:34:18] <zetok> lol
[21:34:44] <ovalseven8_> Something like C# but for cross-platform tools is what I had in mind
[21:34:59] <zetok> if you want to create something broken
[21:35:32] <ovalseven8_> C# works great for Windows, but not necessarily for Linux & MacOS (Mono)
[21:37:34] *** Quits: f10__ (~flo@ ) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[21:38:03] <zetok> no, c# is broken, AFAICT
[21:38:21] *** Joins: f10__ (~flo@ )
[21:40:39] <ovalseven8_> zetok: Why do you think so?
[21:41:00] <zetok> does it segfault?
[21:42:40] <ovalseven8_> zetok: Normally no
[21:42:50] <zetok> >normally
[21:42:57] <zetok> oh, but it does! :3
[21:43:03] <zetok> thus, it's broken.
[21:43:05] <ovalseven8_> zetok, Does it?
[21:43:10] <zetok> yep
[21:43:50] <ovalseven8_> zetok, C# has automatic memory management
[21:46:03] <zetok> ok
[21:48:09] <zetok> right, it uses GC
[21:52:11] <ovalseven8_> zetok, Are there already good GUI frameworks for Rust by the way?
[21:52:30] <zetok> nope, AFAICT :/
[21:52:51] <zetok> that is, one can use GTK binding, but that's not really portable
[21:53:39] <zetok> there's libui binding, but it looks ~ded
[21:54:07] <zetok> and there's native Rust framework, which isn't yet good enough to use for more complex stuff
[21:54:22] <ovalseven8_> I see
[21:54:31] <zetok> there are other things, but aren't really good
