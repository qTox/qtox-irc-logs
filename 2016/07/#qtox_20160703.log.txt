[07:42:11] <zetok> new binaries wipe out old files
[07:42:31] <zetok> ?
[07:42:34] <zetok> dunno :/
[07:43:02] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] RegZi opened pull request #3463: docs(CONTRIBUTING.md): Changed commit message type descriptions for less confusion. (master...DocsFix) https://git.io/vKfqJ
[07:43:13] <tux3> Oh!
[07:43:25] <tux3> Right... my script cleans up before updating things
[07:43:48] <tux3> Hm
[07:44:17] <tux3> What if I make a new qTox PGP key to sign the binaries, and have the script do it on that machiine?
[07:44:29] <zetok> :/
[07:44:44] <zetok> that wouldn't be really good
[07:45:20] <tux3> Why is that?
[07:45:32] <tux3> I could sign that key and publish it
[07:45:48] <zetok> https://blogs.gentoo.org/mgorny/2016/04/15/why-automated-gentoo-mirror-commits-are-not-signed-and-how-to-verify-them-2/
[07:46:45] <tux3> Well, I've only skimmed the thing, but let me address it
[07:47:47] <tux3> 1) We already have the windows update keys on that same server, so adding the installer signing keys to the same machine would not add any extra significant risk
[07:48:42] <tux3> 2) I trust people who have access to that machine to not tamper with anything, if I can't trust them I'm screwed anyway as they could mess with Jenkins
[07:50:09] <tux3> 3) Since I'd have a revocation cert, if something ever goes wrong it's easy to react
[07:50:18] <tux3> Do you see a problem in there?
[07:51:01] <zetok> not a problem per se, it's just that your "own" signature would be better
[07:51:19] <tux3> No, no it would not :/
[07:51:43] <tux3> Then if the server gets compromised I can't revoke the key, and the attackers get to impersonate me in all kind of places
[07:52:12] <zetok> err
[07:52:14] <tux3> Well I'd have to revoke the key, but that would be a pain
[07:52:20] <zetok> no, that's not what I meant
[07:52:24] <tux3> ?
[07:52:50] <zetok> I meant to keep the current "workflow", but modify scripts to not remove signatures
[07:53:05] <zetok> and keep signing installer locally
[07:53:19] <tux3> Yeah, the current workflow is annoying and I don't have time to do everything manually, so I'm automating it.
[07:53:38] <zetok> :/
[07:53:47] <tux3> If you have an argument against automating it, I'm listenning
[07:56:18] <tux3> Do we have some sort of official qTox email? Or I can just put mine I guess
[07:56:33] <tux3> I don't know if the support mailing list is appropriate
[07:59:26] <zetok> there's no qTox mail
[08:04:57] <tux3> Hm actually I wonder if I should put the signature directly on Jenkins and have Jenkins sign the installers
[08:05:19] <zetok> that would be bad
[08:05:29] <tux3> Yeah, let's not

[08:16:39] <nurupo> less people have access to that machine than to jenkins
[08:16:58] <nurupo> and i wouldn't have to import your private key to the on-demand build machine

[10:36:49] <tux3> zetok, do you know why Travis is exploding on https://github.com/tux3/qTox/pull/3463 ?
[10:37:09] <zetok> > Update CONTRIBUTING.md
[10:37:32] <tux3> OOOh >.<
[10:37:34] <tux3> Argh.
[10:37:50] <zetok> you know, we've been wondering with sudden6 whether people actually read travis output
[10:38:09] <zetok> https://travis-ci.org/tux3/qTox/jobs/141958973#L168
[10:38:12] <tux3> I tried, but since it doesn't stop after an error, the actual problem is burried within 100k of logs...
[10:38:21] <tux3> Just saw i
[10:38:22] <tux3> it
[10:38:33] <zetok> hmm, so it should be moved to the end?
[10:39:13] <tux3> Either 1) make it EXIT on error, instead of continuing to build hapilly, or 2) sum up all the errors at the end
[10:39:22] <anoa> zetok: Are group lists still not updating for you when you change a friend alias?
[10:39:53] <zetok> tux3: I'll see if exiting build is possible
[10:40:00] <tux3> zetok, thanks :)
[10:41:22] <zero-ghost> zetok how do i attach to a running CLI program in terminal
[10:41:31] <zetok> anoa: um?
[10:41:51] <zetok> zero-ghost: if it's about gdb, `gdb -p $pid`
[10:42:02] <anoa> zetok: for #781, what problem are you still experiencing?
[10:42:24] <zetok> zero-ghost: once attached, type `continue` if you want program to keep running until the crash
[10:42:46] <zetok> anoa: groupchat displays alias instead of nick
[10:42:57] <zero-ghost> i dont have gdb installed
[10:43:08] <zero-ghost> i mean just a general program thats running headless
[10:43:22] <zetok> um, you don't?
[10:43:28] <zero-ghost> i can double click a binary and see it running in task manager
[10:43:36] <zero-ghost> i cant attach toit to see its output
[10:43:41] <zetok> strace ?
[10:43:55] <anoa> zetok: I thought that was intended behaviour? From issue: "Although one person is "Person A" in my friend list - in group chat he has another name"
[10:44:01] <tux3> zetok, tail -F /proc/<pid>/fd/1 ?
[10:44:04] <tux3> zero-ghost, ^
[10:45:23] <zero-ghost> just sits there
[10:46:06] <zetok> anoa: not really
[10:46:26] <zetok> anoa: that's the description of the wrong behaviour
[10:46:36] <tux3> zetok, tail -F will show the output as it happens, but you can't get the history or easyly interract with the program
[10:46:41] <tux3> Damn, I mean zero-ghost ^
[10:46:46] <tux3> Wrong ze<TAB> :)
[10:47:05] <zero-ghost> oh ok
[10:47:16] <zero-ghost> how about getting the history?
[10:47:21] <zetok> >_>
[10:47:27] <zero-ghost> and there is no interaction with this program
[10:47:30] <tux3> You can't, the output history is not kept anywhere.
[10:47:42] <zero-ghost> but id like to have it headless and be able to just attach and see the history
[10:47:46] <zero-ghost> yea damn...
[10:47:48] <zetok> eh
[10:47:50] <zetok> just use screen
[10:47:56] <zetok> + increase screen history
[10:48:00] <zero-ghost> yea someone told me about screen and i was trying it
[10:48:03] <zero-ghost> seems the best way
[10:48:06] <zetok> (but not too much, otherwise it'll eat your ram)
[10:48:09] <zero-ghost> i thought linux was better than that though ;)
[10:48:09] <tux3> Use nohup if you want to keep the history, use tmux/screen if you want to detach/reattach later
[10:48:44] <anoa> zetok: If you change a friend's alias then it changes in groupchat, thus groupchat and friends list has same name which is opposite of the wrong behavior I mentioned above.

[10:52:56] <anoa> Just not really sure what the issue still is
[10:53:29] <zetok> anoa: um, the correct behaviour is not altering what is displayed in groupchat, regardless of whether alias is set
[10:53:48] <zetok> or at least this way of handling things seems to cause least amount of trouble
[10:55:30] <anoa> Oh I see, whereas a user would mention "alice", they would be referring to who everyone else saw as "bob".
[10:56:38] <zetok> yeah
[10:56:48] <anoa> I didn't understand the problem, thanks. As a solution I suppose we could show both, though how to do so would require some ux thought.
[10:57:07] <zetok> well, there is one ;)
[10:57:47] <zetok> anoa: https://github.com/tux3/qTox/issues/1195 ?
[10:58:43] <anoa> That would work, though someone could name themselves alice / bob, so perhaps some color distinction is necessary? We could also do Nick <i>Alias</i>
[10:59:19] <zetok> um, suggested way is to use cursive for `(Name)`
[10:59:55] <anoa> Cursive meaning italics? Yeah, that's what I think would be good, something that wouldn't be reproducible by a normal user with a nick only.
[11:00:02] <zetok> yeah

[13:16:26] <tux3> package config just looks for system-wide packages afaik

[13:20:54] <zetok> tux3: so should PKG_CONFIG_PATH be used by whatever wants to make static builds, or qtox.pro has to have more `if`s ?
[13:21:53] <tux3> You could export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:./libs/ or something like that
[13:22:05] <tux3> It needs to work for both system-wide packages and local packages
[13:22:31] <tux3> But I don't know if it'll work out of the box if you just point it a ./libs
[13:22:52] <tux3> You probably need to copy the .pc files in the right place too
[13:23:06] <zetok> ./libs/pkgconfig
[13:23:19] <tux3> If that exists, sounds perfect
[13:23:39] <zetok> dunno if it exists
[13:31:39] <zetok> actually libs/lib/pkgconfig/

[14:58:05] <Saamm> Hello everyone ^^
[15:07:50] <tux3> Hi
[15:17:59] <ovalseven8> tux3, zetok: Seems like we may use the icons! \o/
[15:18:11] <zetok> awesome :)
[15:19:09] <ovalseven8> tux3, zetok: They would offer also paid access for free, but I think we don't need it. The 100x100 PNG should be enough for us, right?
[15:19:20] <zetok> uh
[15:19:25] <zetok> there's no .svg ?
[15:19:36] <ovalseven8> There is .svg, but only for paid access
[15:19:45] <zetok> makes sense
[15:20:44] <ovalseven8> zetok, Do we necessarily need .svg?
[15:21:21] <zetok> .png are really bad to store in git, and aren't future-proof, like svg
[15:29:42] <ovalseven8> zetok, tux3: So, question is: Should we ask for a premium account or are we happy with normal PNG? :)
[15:30:11] <tux3> ovalseven8, premium account as in paying :) ? Because I don't really have a qTox budget!
[15:30:24] <zetok> how badly do we need those icons?
[15:30:37] <ovalseven8> tux3: They give us premium account for free if we want
[15:30:44] *** Quits: f10__ (~flo@ ) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:30:55] <zetok> oh
[15:31:06] <tux3> Well no harm in asking then!
[15:31:12] <zetok> ovalseven8: we need only icons for settings, right?
[15:31:39] <ovalseven8> At the moment, yes. But I guess there are other icons we could use and replace ugly icons in qTox with them
[15:33:14] <zetok> ovalseven8: um, given their circumstances, I think that it would be the best to use as few as possible?
[15:34:17] <ovalseven8> zetok, It depends: Normal .png with 50x50 or 100x100 is limited it seems. SVG (premium account needed) we should not use too much.
[15:34:29] <ovalseven8> *is not limited
[15:36:26] <zetok> um, it's preferable to not use PNGs at all
[15:36:44] <zetok> i.e. only when there's really no other choice
[15:36:57] <ovalseven8> zetok, well, please look -> https://github.com/tux3/qTox/tree/master/img/icons
[15:37:07] <ovalseven8> I don't think PNG's are such a problem
[15:38:04] <zetok> yeah, those icons should be "thrown away" at some point to just generate them automatically from .svg
[15:38:17] <zetok> except that you don't really throw away things with git
[15:38:31] <zetok> and they will be left in git history forever
[15:39:09] <ovalseven8> zetok: Well, then probably I will ask for a premium account?
[15:39:31] <zetok> needed for ~3 icons, right?
[15:39:45] <ovalseven8> 5, I guess
[15:40:03] <zetok> oh wait
[15:40:18] <ovalseven8> And I would know some to replace in qTox :D
[15:40:27] <zetok> there's PR by Diadlo that adds UI tab
[15:40:43] <ovalseven8> For example "Remove" avatar icon :P

[15:42:01] <zetok> https://a.uguu.se/jj247DFrsmim.png ?
[15:42:25] <ovalseven8> It looks different for me
[15:42:50] <zetok> icon theme :)
[15:45:20] <zetok> i.e. you set it in your gtk/kde settings
[15:54:43] <ovalseven8> So should I ask for the 6 .svg icons? https://github.com/tux3/qTox/pull/3457#issuecomment-230091930
[15:55:17] *** Quits: f10 (~flo@ ) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[15:55:30] <ovalseven8> zetok, This should be the default "remove" icon, no? 
[15:57:54] *** Joins: f10 (~flo@ )
[15:58:33] <zetok> ovalseven8: not sure if icons for UI and A/V are a good fit
[15:58:53] <ovalseven8> zetok: Choose another ;)
[15:59:43] <ovalseven8> I guess it'd be a great deal if we just ask them if we need a nice icon in .svg format. So they don't have to give us a premium account.
[16:00:05] <ovalseven8> And we have all we need :)
[16:08:03] <zetok> ovalseven8: UI: https://icons8.com/web-app/12681/navigation-toolbar-left-filled ?
[16:08:18] <zetok> as for A/V, look at the `video` ones
[16:09:38] <zetok> also, IMO current Privacy icon is already good
[16:10:47] <ovalseven8> Well, I think the qTox icon for "Privacy" not so good
[16:10:57] <ovalseven8> It's the program's icon
[16:11:39] <zetok> exactly
[16:12:19] <zetok> >qTox is built on a "privacy goes first" agenda, and we make no compromises.
[16:12:30] <zetok> ;D
[16:13:02] <ovalseven8> Of course, I understand. It's just a matter of opinion :D
[16:16:40] <ovalseven8> zetok, For A/V? https://icons8.com/web-app/10329/webcam-filled
[16:18:16] <zetok> https://a.uguu.se/RQ7r8kRAjX7W.png ← not good enough, eh?

[16:22:38] <ovalseven8> zetok, Yep, we can use that
[16:22:41] <zetok> + colour other than black
[16:24:17] <ovalseven8> zetok, Mh... if one is colored it look inconsistent
[16:24:37] <zetok> mm, icons shouldn't be black
[16:25:18] <zetok> https://a.uguu.se/j6m4Uy8yxJOe.png ?
[16:26:09] <ovalseven8> zetok, also the tab is gray 
[16:26:37] <zetok> oh, right

[16:27:17] <ovalseven8> Allright
[16:27:43] <ovalseven8> zetok, But then we also need colored icons for the other tabs?

[20:34:05] <nurupo> tux3: zetok: hey, we got the next comment on the multi-device blog post: "I wish the toxing was happy but it wasn't. https://github.com/tux3/qTox/issues/2726 , https://github.com/tux3/qTox/issues/2820 and https://github.com/tux3/qTox/pull/2771 have all been reported half a year ago and nobody does anything about them. Nobody. Instead, we get more new features such as multi-device support, which, judging by the 3 bugs above (the third one is solved and 
[20:34:05] <nurupo> just needs rebasing, for Christ's sake) is going to be just as (un)usable."
[20:35:52] <tux3> One of them is a toxcore issue that we'd need to hack around, one is a new feature, and one is a legit bug
[20:37:14] <zetok> also the PR doesn't require "just a rebase"
[20:37:21] <zetok> it needs to be fixed first
[20:37:34] <zetok> or rather, it needs to be rebased, then fixed

[23:09:33] <koshii> Hi there.
[23:09:48] <koshii> I am using the debian repo version of qtox, how to invite users to a group chat?
[23:10:17] <ovalseven8> koshii, Right-click and you can invite the user
[23:10:46] <ovalseven8> Of course, you first have to join a group
[23:11:21] <koshii> I am in the group
[23:11:23] <koshii> I created it
[23:11:38] <koshii> Right clicking on the left bar on the name of the group gives me these options: Open chat in new window, Set title..., Quit group
[23:11:57] <koshii> Right-clicking in the chat area gives me: Copy, Select all, Save chat log, Clear displayed messages, Quote selected text
[23:12:05] <ovalseven8> You have to click on the name of the user you'd like to invite
[23:12:23] <koshii> Ah there isn't a dialog for invites, I see
