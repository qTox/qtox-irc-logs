[10:17:56] <Saaaam> Hello everyone ^^
[10:18:48] <zetok> hello Saaaam :)
[10:18:55] <Saaaam> zetok: as you asked, all the flags have been done: https://github.com/Saaaam/qtox_website_test/tree/top-langs/assets/imgs/flags
[10:20:18] <Saaaam> (I'm on travel these days, so I'm not close to my computer, I'm more on the road) ;)
[10:20:51] <zetok> Saaaam: https://github.com/qTox/qtox-irc-logs/blob/master/2016/07/%23qtox_20160715.log.txt#L96 :)
[10:21:44] <Saaaam> :p
[10:22:53] <zetok> is "don't break" doable?
[10:23:58] <Saaaam> Yup, that's what I read in your link, it "may" be possible asking this. Wait 5 minuts, I'm gonna check the W3C website
[10:24:36] <zetok> https://github.com/zetok/qTox-Website/commit/14f15d7f525a47e0554b856848dccdfe6a5ca952#diff-cda308940599c6096ae1817a13057e91L8 ‚Üê¬†changed, it didn't breaks with this, but there was big ugly box with flag on top of language name
[10:30:47] <Saaaam> white-space: nowrap;
[10:31:45] <zetok> ooh, awesome
[10:32:25] <Saaaam> I just hope the whole flag + language shortcup will jump out the line
[10:32:27] <zetok> https://a.uguu.se/PuyDOUtQmlyk.png
[10:32:44] <Saaaam> ...
[10:32:49] <Saaaam> Indeed, it does >.>
[10:34:03] <Saaaam> is it possible to use only 2-3 letters for that language?
[10:35:41] <zetok> ~yep
[10:35:50] <Saaaam> Hum, nevermind, I just looked at the code, and this is about the "[[[language]]]"
[10:36:33] <Saaaam> Don't you think it could be better to use [[[lang_shortcode]]] instead of [[[language]]] ?
[10:36:56] <zetok> not really
[10:37:45] <zetok> I might be wrong about that though
[10:39:00] <Saaaam> Or, other solution, we just display the flag
[10:39:10] <zetok> mm
[10:39:19] <zetok> I wonder if that'll be clear enough?
[10:39:26] <Saaaam> It is something usual in websites
[10:39:40] <Saaaam> Example : https://www.neobux.com/
[10:40:06] <Saaaam> you have just a flag, and as is it near the nav bar, it "is" something clickable
[10:40:21] <zetok> ok
[10:40:34] <Saaaam> I mean, that's what occurs in people's mind
[10:41:50] <Saaaam> Or we can wait for a 3rd opinion about that ^^

[10:45:34] <zetok> btw, since click just scrolls down, would it be possible to somehow "flash" or otherwise visually mark for a moment language section?
[10:49:24] <Saaaam> We can add a "title" attribute to the link, like <a href="#languages" id="langbutton" title="Language Selection"> ; is it what you're looking for? :3
[10:50:24] <Saaaam> Hum... even "Languages" only, not "language selection". The shorter the better.
[10:50:52] <zetok> not really, but that will be useful too
[10:51:20] <zetok> i.e. something that would "blink" the section itself one user has clicked on link
[10:51:33] <zetok> or is that unnecessary?

[10:51:59] <zetok> https://a.uguu.se/sA6RdAAyrHfB.png ‚Üê without language name that box looks a bit too big
[10:53:25] <Saaaam> Too big on the left & right, not enough on top and bottom
[10:53:42] <Saaaam> To tell the truth, I don't think it is indeed possible
[10:53:48] <zetok> ok
[10:56:27] <Saaaam> https://github.com/qTox/qTox-Website/blob/langs-link/assets/css/language-menu-top.css#L13  
[10:56:34] <Saaaam> It comes from here I think
[10:56:56] <Saaaam> We can try : `padding: .3em;`
[10:57:07] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox-Website/blob/langs-link/assets/css/language-menu-top.css#L13 ‚Üê with `.4em`
[10:57:20] <Saaaam> :p
[10:57:28] <Saaaam> okay, go for .4em  ;)
[11:01:33] <Saaaam> By the way, did you like the way the flags were displayed in the appearing box in my first try? I mean, flag+language, into 4 columns, with a little color effect when the mouse was over 1 language?
[11:01:50] <zetok> yep
[11:02:38] <zetok> it's just that functionality breaking due to screen size/zoom is not an option IMO
[11:03:54] <Saaaam> Well, in the box, it was indeed complicated. Because the box had to have a specifized width and height.
[11:04:54] <Saaaam> But I can try to display the menu at the bottom of the page the same way. It must be good, as the width and height are automatically handled by the browser

[11:05:53] <Saaaam> I can give a shot if you want, and if it works, go for it. If it seems that problems occurs, back to the way they are currently display
[11:06:22] <zetok> if you think it's worth it, why not
[11:06:33] <Saaaam> Hum... why not `padding: .4em;` ?
[11:06:56] <Saaaam> (so all the sides, even top and bottom, will have that little space)

[11:17:14] <Saaaam> The "white-space: nowrap;" isn't useful anymore for the button (as we remove [[[language]]]), but we can try to put this for the <nav>

[20:46:13] <nurupo> tux3: could you check qtox builds on build.tox.chat?
[20:46:57] <nurupo> i think the windows ones are failing after some recent commit in qtox
[20:47:07] <nurupo> i emailed you about that before
[20:47:18] <nurupo> not sure if you got it fixed or not
[20:47:36] <tux3> >Invalid command: ShellExecAsUser::ShellExecAsUser
[20:47:51] <tux3> Looks like the DigitalOcean build VM is missing a NSIS plugin 
[20:47:54] <nurupo> what is this, powershell?
[20:48:05] <tux3> Our installer
[20:48:11] <tux3> NullSoft Install System (NSIS)
[20:48:22] <nurupo> you mean nsis package?
[20:48:26] <tux3> Ya
[20:48:37] <nurupo> confused me with "plugin"
[20:48:44] <tux3> We use a NSIS plugin called ShellExecuteAsUser to deal with the broken Windows UAC thing.
[20:48:49] <nurupo> it seems to run nsis halfway though
[20:48:50] <tux3> Someone needs to install it.
[20:48:52] <nurupo> oh
[20:49:10] <zetok> tux3: btw, https://github.com/tux3/qTox/issues/3517 ‚Üê looks like people didn't get the changelog memo
[20:49:43] <nurupo> can't find the plugin in debian repos
[20:50:01] <tux3> zetok, I haven't done the zenity/kdialog popup yet, but I though the changelog had worked :/
[20:50:13] <zetok> tux3: apparently it didn't :(
[20:50:21] <nurupo> unless it uses some weird name
[20:50:31] <zetok> tux3: since Encrypt now is supposed to take care of packages, he'll do it
[20:50:40] <tux3> zetok, sounds good
[20:50:59] <tux3> nurupo, IIRC I had to get the code from here: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/images/c/c7/ShellExecAsUser.zip
[20:52:23] <tux3> The code is a Visual Studio 6 project (!), but you can just use the magic totally-not-malware-I-swear DLL.
[20:52:28] <nurupo> ok, now i roughly know what to do, will figure this out later, got to go now
[20:52:35] <tux3> Awesome, thanks
[20:52:58] <tux3> Or maybe one day we'll switch to a better installer.
[20:55:58] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox-Website/pull/6 ‚Üê opinions?
[20:58:56] <tux3> Why is the language on its own separate line?
[20:59:00] <tux3> Otherwise I like the screenshot
[20:59:16] <zetok> it's only like that when there's not enough space on top
[20:59:19] <tux3> And the logo still looks super weird
[20:59:35] <tux3> Ok, maybe slightly smaller font so it doesn't overflow then?
[20:59:44] <tux3> Or remove some margin on the left?
[20:59:53] <zetok> um, it works well with most of languages
[21:00:06] <tux3> "most" is a bug, we want "all" :)
[21:00:10] <zetok> ok
[21:00:15] <zetok> dunno then how to make it work
[21:00:22] <tux3> Smaller fonts don't work?
[21:00:41] <zetok> yep, it's just a matter of how much one zooms the page
[21:00:49] <zetok> at some point it'll be the same
[21:01:12] <tux3> Well.
[21:01:21] <tux3> Alright, whatever
[21:01:34] <tux3> So we won't have a hipster-approved responsive website
[21:02:00] <zetok> https://a.uguu.se/yA4HJyl4Ir35.png ‚Üê with smaller zoom

[21:09:42] <zetok> well, jekyll makes making a blog braindead simple
[21:10:10] <zetok> from 0 knowledge, in a few minutes one has a blog
[21:10:29] <zetok> now the only thing missing is content
[21:12:44] <tux3> Cool. Now, before publishing stuff in the name of the qTox project, be sure to always have someone review it first!

[21:43:14] <zetok> :s

[21:45:31] <zetok> um?
[21:46:05] <zetok> I've deleted it
[21:46:54] <zetok> also, from what I understood the base jekyll dir (what's on master) was supposed to be just pushed to gh-pages for it to work
[21:47:45] <tux3> hm
[21:48:45] <zetok> I can setup travis to do the build & push to gh-pages branch, but.. is it really required?
[21:51:12] <tux3> Maybe it'll be easier to do it manually than to fight with travis...
[21:51:19] <tux3> Travis is such a pain sometimes
[21:53:23] <zetok> err

[22:11:53] <sudden6> hi
[22:12:05] <sudden6> a little bit late to the party...
[22:13:46] <tux3> hello!
[22:15:52] <sudden6> tux3: would be nice if you could review Diadlo's PRs https://github.com/tux3/qTox/pull/3488
[22:16:05] <sudden6> and https://github.com/tux3/qTox/pull/3489
[22:16:25] <sudden6> because I'm still working on understanding const
[22:18:37] <sudden6> ah wait, antis81 is already on it, didn't notice that...
[22:20:12] <zetok> sudden6: https://github.com/tux3/qTox/pull/3512 ?
[22:20:36] <zetok> btw
[22:20:41] <sudden6> didn't test it yet
[22:21:34] <tux3> Wow that const PR is huge!
[22:22:19] <sudden6> I think that's called technical debt in newspeak
[22:23:01] <tux3> :)

[22:25:43] <abbat> Hi! zetok, would you merge new translations (RU)?
[22:26:01] <zetok> right
[22:27:44] <zetok> abbat: usually I try to wait a ~day after last change on weblate, in case where someone is still working on a translation, unless there's something on master qTox/PR that would cause conflicts on weblate, then I'm pulling it sooner
[22:28:10] <zetok> last change across all languages
[22:28:10] <abbat> Ah, ok. Waiting
[22:29:08] <zetok> there's been some changes there, and also 1 new string on master, so I guess it's the time
[22:31:29] <sudden6> zetok: nice read
