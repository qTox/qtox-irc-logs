[11:00:20] <bashrc> does video calling currently in a working condition? It looks like my webcams are working, and they can be selected within qTox but I see no video.
[11:01:00] <bashrc> toxcore was compiled with av, and audio is working
[11:01:09] <sudden6> bashrc: video isn't completely stable
[11:01:14] <bashrc> ah
[11:01:24] <BiTOk> can you create issue with commit hash and log attached?
[11:01:24] <sudden6> maybe you could open an issue and provide logs?
[11:01:43] <sudden6> also, you could try and build from git master
[11:01:49] <bashrc> ok, where is stuff logged to?
[11:01:56] <sudden6> there were many fixes since the last release
[11:02:13] <sudden6> linux ~/cache/tox I think
[11:02:22] <sudden6> or console output
[11:02:38] <BiTOk> what OS do you use?
[11:03:00] <bashrc> I'm currently using 1.4.0-339-ge6e666f-obs
[11:03:58] <sudden6> ok linux then
[11:04:12] <bashrc> commit hash e6e666fa8ce36cd3792d4536a59ab2b65fd5b546
[11:04:30] <bashrc> yes linux, debian stable with backports
[11:05:34] <sudden6> ok, build is pretty recent, no need for git master
[11:06:17] <sudden6> best would be to upload logs to gist.github.com and then link to it
[11:06:33] <sudden6> (or any other paste service)
[11:07:11] <bashrc> where does qtox log to?
[11:07:24] <sudden6> ~/.cache/Tox/qtox
[11:10:12] <bashrc> nothing in ~/.cache
[11:11:33] <sudden6> hmm, then just run it from terminal and copy the output when the error happens
[11:11:40] <bashrc> ok
[11:12:11] <bashrc> actually not logging anything by default is probably a feature
[11:14:51] <bashrc> looks like it's not finding /dev/video0
[11:15:24] <bashrc> video4linux2 no such input format : .
[11:15:48] <bashrc> camerasource.cpp:233 failed to open device
[11:16:41] <bashrc> camera works ok in cheese
[11:17:12] <sudden6> no logging should be default
[11:17:23] <bashrc> good
[11:17:37] <sudden6> hm, we already have recent issue with similiar message
[11:17:47] <sudden6> and I meant, qtox should be logging by default
[11:18:20] <bashrc> /dev/video0 does exist, so this might be a permissions thing
[11:18:26] <sudden6> bashrc: https://github.com/tux3/qTox/issues/3562 is this the same like your issue?
[11:18:38] <bashrc> ok if it's a known issue
[11:20:18] <bashrc> yes, same log messages
[11:20:23] <sudden6> bashrc: could you attach output from v4l2-ctl --list-formats-ext
[11:20:29] <sudden6> to the issue?
[11:20:39] <sudden6> would help to debug the problem
[11:20:44] <bashrc> ok
[11:21:17] <bashrc> v4l2-ctl command not found
[11:21:49] <sudden6> you probably have to install it
[11:22:13] <sudden6> v4l-utils for debian
[11:22:17] <bashrc> ok. Could be a while because the system isn't on the internet and installing things means rebuilding the image
[11:23:50] <sudden6> no problem, just attach it to the issue above when you have time

[12:08:58] <zetok> bashrc: why not just have a "local" mirror of debian packages?
[12:09:22] <bashrc> not on a small USB drive :)
[12:09:48] <zetok> right, but you've mentioned that you have some mesh there?
[12:10:13] <bashrc> I'm testing mesh peers. They all run from 8GB USB sticks
[12:10:23] <zetok> also, there are USB drives with >128GB capacity, and debian mirror is 120GB from what I've heard
[12:10:33] <zetok> I see
[12:11:46] <bashrc> anyone know of any good CC avatar image sets?
[12:12:37] <sudden6> zetok: since when qTox is in qTox org?^^
[12:12:41] <zetok> bashrc: https://github.com/tux3/qTox/issues/711 ?
[12:12:44] <sudden6> also hi :)
[12:12:54] <zetok> hello sudden6
[12:13:45] <zetok> sudden6: since tux3 is kil
[12:13:49] <bashrc> that would be ok, but really I was thinking of something more artistic
[12:15:33] <sudden6> zetok: you might rethink the usage of kil https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Kil ;)
[12:16:04] <zetok> uh
[12:16:40] <zetok> right
[12:17:28] <sudden6> and much more important, what will be the main repo now?
[12:18:10] <zetok> I've been wondering about that
[12:19:31] <zetok> well, the main problem is that stuff relies too much on gh, and because of that changing repo would be really problematic
[12:19:52] <sudden6> also if org repo is new repo, could we move old issues?
[12:20:16] <zetok> so, from that point, one could either get rid of most of gh dependencies, or not change repo, staying with status quo
[12:20:31] <zetok> nope
[12:21:19] <zetok> what do you think about getting rid of most gh dependencies?
[12:21:40] <sudden6> we should make a plan first
[12:22:11] <zetok> err
[12:22:17] <zetok> no, plan comes later
[12:22:46] <zetok> first you should evaluate all possible options that are there
[12:22:56] <sudden6> mhm
[12:23:14] <zetok> and once you know that one option is more preferable than others, you go with it and plan accordingly
[12:24:17] <sudden6> ok, what dependencies on gh do we have? Issue tracker, repo hosting, website hosting, travis CI
[12:24:27] <sudden6> anything I forgot?
[12:24:41] <sudden6> also community
[12:25:06] <zetok> issue references, both in commits and the code
[12:25:14] <sudden6> mhm
[12:26:18] <sudden6> so what can we replace without making things worse?
[12:26:47] <sudden6> website hosting would probably be easiest and without much troubles
[12:26:56] <sudden6> but also without much benefits
[12:27:10] <bashrc> added https://github.com/tux3/qTox/issues/3572
[12:31:02] <sudden6> zetok: we also talked about making testing for users easier
[12:31:23] <zetok> I dunno about "replacing"
[12:31:31] <sudden6> maybe we could combine simple-make.sh with test-pr.sh
[12:31:47] <sudden6> so one could do simple-make.sh $PR
[12:32:13] <sudden6> zetok: what were you thinking about?
[12:32:33] <zetok> just making qTox depend less
[12:32:47] <sudden6> also without making things worse was wrong, they should be better afterwards
[12:36:44] <zetok> meh.
[12:36:46] <BiTOk> why MicFeedbackWidget still there is?
[12:37:15] <zetok> it was disabled only "for time being", until it gets fixed
[12:38:14] <zetok> sudden6: right now I'm not sure if anything should be done, since I don't know if tux3 will want to cooperate, assuming that he's fine and well
[12:39:01] <zetok> i.e. it would be the best if all the stuff associated with the repo could be kept, if not, I'll start thinking about making a migration somehow
[12:39:08] <sudden6> ah ok, it came to me you want this done asap
[12:39:26] <zetok> not really
[12:39:58] <zetok> right now I just want to highlight the need
[12:40:57] <sudden6> I think repo hosting and Issue tracking is pretty much bound to gh for now
[12:41:03] <zetok> not really
[12:41:23] <zetok> they're bound, not to the gh, but to tux3
[12:42:07] <zetok> i.e. repo can be moved on gh, and to gitlab, keeping all the issues, etc, but that requires admin privileges, which only tux3 has
[12:42:27] <sudden6> ah, didn't know that's possible
[12:42:52] <sudden6> but why does gitlab need admin for that? aren't the issues readable anyway
[12:43:25] <zetok> hmm
[12:43:35] <zetok> wait, I see an "import" button there for tux3/qTox repo
[12:43:40] <zetok> >.<
[12:44:07] <sudden6> lol
[12:44:35] * zetok wonders whether that would work
[12:44:37] <sudden6> but we are still bound to gh by our community
[12:45:00] <sudden6> what about just trying?

[12:52:33] <BiTOk> zetok: what do you think about add donation feature for qTox?
[12:52:51] <zetok> BiTOk: that would require someone to manage the money
[12:53:03] <BiTOk> project manager
[12:53:03] <sudden6> BiTOk: where should donations go?
[12:53:17] <zetok> BiTOk: and who would be the project manager?
[12:53:24] <BiTOk> maybe you?
[12:53:36] <zetok> :|
[12:53:37] <BiTOk> sudden6: paypal, bitcoin?
[12:54:09] <zetok> sudden6: um, I'm not sure if you can import things multiple times after deleting a repo
[12:54:09] <BiTOk> project can't be without administration
[12:54:26] <sudden6> IMHO the only doable solution atm would be donations directly to people
[12:54:27] <zetok> sudden6: so it would be good if you don't click on import yet
[12:54:44] <sudden6> zetok: ok
[12:54:57] <zetok> sudden6: nick on gitlab?
[12:55:08] <sudden6> zetok: sudden6
[12:55:23] <BiTOk> sudden6: it's difficult to select people to donate. donate should be easy and clear
[12:55:53] <sudden6> that was also the death argument last time it came up...
[12:56:02] *** Quits: sudd3n6 (~anonymous@ ) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[12:56:18] <sudden6> problem is, qTox doesn't really have a manager in the traditional sense
[12:56:44] <sudden6> much less does qTox have someone who wants to take responsibilities with mone
[12:56:48] <sudden6> y
[12:57:09] <BiTOk> I think, qTox should find traditional manager
[12:57:45] <BiTOk> and he should get money for his work
[12:58:20] <zetok> sudden6: added you to `qTox` group
[12:58:26] <sudden6> zetok: thx
[12:59:15] <sudden6> zetok: but I think we should keep the gitlab qtox repo closed till a need arises
[12:59:23] <zetok> yeah
[12:59:48] <zetok> this is just testing, to see if migrating stuff would be possible
[13:00:01] <sudden6> yep
[13:00:33] <sudden6> seems to work for now :)
[13:01:37] <sudden6> hmm, I liked my github identicon more, reminded me of space invaders :)
[13:01:59] <zetok> yeah
[13:02:59] <sudden6> [13:31] <sudden6> maybe we could combine simple-make.sh with test-pr.sh
[13:03:01] <sudden6> [13:31] <sudden6> so one could do simple-make.sh $PR
[13:03:02] <sudden6> [13:32] <sudden6> zetok: what were you thinking about?
[13:03:33] <zetok> requiring more useful info in commits & code
[13:03:57] <zetok> not really needed though, since we kinda can just import into gitlab
[13:04:06] <sudden6> ah damn, last line shouldn't be there
[13:04:36] <zetok> well, we might "require", but people are generally lazy, and the less they have to do, the "better"
[13:04:46] <zetok> aka, easier to contribute
[13:05:11] <sudden6> I'm ok with referencing issue numbers in PRs and commit messages, but they shouldn't be in the code
[13:05:39] <zetok> BiTOk: I'm not sure if I would be a good person for project manager
[13:06:02] <sudden6> actually I wanted your opinion about combining simple-make.sh and test-pr.sh
[13:06:02] <zetok> sudden6: right
[13:06:25] <zetok> sudden6: vagrant doesn't sound good?
[13:06:49] <zetok> I'm not sure if combining is a good idea

[13:11:31] <zetok> sudden6: https://www.vagrantup.com/
[13:12:28] <zetok> tux3: no problem, we've been testing importing repo on gitlab :)
[13:12:39] <sudden6> ah^^ I read it literally
[13:12:58] <zetok> https://a.uguu.se/2Qgl5ZeTgVSV.png ← looks like it failed :c
[13:13:34] <zetok> only like a sixth of issues was imported
[13:13:50] <sudden6> :(
[13:14:19] <zetok> so, in practice it does seem to require admin privileges
[13:14:28] <zetok> (or something)
[13:14:38] <sudden6> is there an error message or something?
[13:15:12] <zetok> I don't see any
[13:16:09] <sudden6> it also hasn't imported code...
[13:17:13] <zetok> yep
[13:17:25] <zetok> this is probably part where it failed

[13:19:45] <zetok> tux3: /j #toktok ?
[13:19:51] <sudden6> please no reviewable
[13:19:55] <zetok> sudden6: hm?
[13:20:01] <zetok> sudden6: it would make reviewing easier
[13:20:04] <sudden6> it's slow and ugly
[13:20:13] <zetok> yes, but it does make htings easier

[13:20:19] <sudden6> no
[13:20:27] <sudden6> bad user interface makes things harder
[13:20:41] <zetok> ok, → toktok ?
[13:22:01] <tux3> Given that we currently have a grand total of not a single unit test, I'm not sure what we would use Coveralls for?
[13:22:32] <zetok> to have it in place for when there will be tests
[13:23:07] <tux3> Are you thinking unit tests or integration tests? I'm all for proper testing but for now we got nothing
[13:23:32] <zetok> both
[13:23:53] <zetok> integration tests will be harder though, since they require from qTox to implement accessibility stuff

[15:35:05] <tux3> >[qTox] BiTOk opened pull request #3573 :)
[15:35:53] <BiTOk> whats wrong with his name?
[15:36:32] <tux3> I don't think you can use "fix,refactor", but I'm not positivve
[15:36:49] <sudden6> BiTOk: only fix or refactor is allowed
[15:36:59] <BiTOk> there is both
[15:37:21] <tux3> If there is really both, maybe split into two commits. Otherwise by the name I'd call it just refactor

[15:38:30] <BiTOk> friendlistwidget.cpp contains av fix for my next PR :-)
[15:39:03] <BiTOk> oh, let it be refactor
[15:39:37] <sudden6> BiTOk: In general, don't put things from one PR into another
[15:39:47] <tux3> Oh right, might be better to split it acutally :)
[15:39:59] <sudden6> i.e. one PR one thing fixed
[15:42:01] <BiTOk> this one really fixed static analyze warnings, but one warning about access violation, that wasn't accured because there is no saving of contact list grouping 
[15:45:03] <BiTOk> I amend it

[16:27:16] <bashrc> I think I see the cause of connection problems. loadGlobal only happens once at start, so when the DHT list later changes as mesh peers are discovered qTox doesn't update itself
[16:28:05] <bashrc> after repeated manual closing and opening it does eventually connect
[16:47:28] <bashrc> one way light be to run loadGlobal whenever Settings::getinstance is called
[16:47:46] <bashrc> and remove the loaded flag
[16:48:20] <bashrc> I could maybe add an extra setting to do that, such as "mesh=true"
