[14:02:06] <cisc> actually just the i586 build
[14:10:11] <zetok> >The build can not begin, because required packages are either missing or not explicitly defined.
[14:10:59] <zetok> cisc: https://github.com/abbat/tox.pkg/tree/master/qtox mind making a PR? :)

[16:44:59] <Encrypt> Hello hello here :)
[16:45:27] <Encrypt> zetok, One of my friends just dist-upgraded his Ubuntu 15.10 to the 16.04 one
[16:45:48] <Encrypt> During a video call, there are glitches
[16:45:56] <Encrypt> Like horizontal lines
[16:46:09] <Encrypt> I don't know if you were aware of such a bug
[16:47:22] <zetok> using which repo?
[16:48:20] <zetok> Encrypt: also, when will you have time to update tox.chat packages?
[16:48:52] <Encrypt> zetok, The OBS one
[16:49:03] <Encrypt> <zetok> Encrypt: also, when will you have time to update tox.chat packages? // Yeah, I didn't answer, sorry
[16:49:24] <Encrypt> zetok, But tux3 is the one packaging qTox on build.tox.chat
[16:49:46] <zetok> hum
[16:49:46] <Encrypt> zetok, + nurupo is the one who has full rights on pkg.tox.chat / build.tox.chat
[16:49:51] <Encrypt> So, I can't do much for you
[16:50:00] <zetok> fok
[16:50:02] <zetok> ok*
[16:50:28] <Encrypt> I wish I had more rights on pkg.tox.chat / build.tox.chat to do stuff
[16:50:55] * zetok will pass to tux3 that he does need to do the stuff
[16:51:42] <zetok> dunno about the bug, haven't heard about it before
[16:53:42] <zetok> >Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
[16:53:42] <zetok> 0x00007ffff4676542 in ff_hscale8to15_8_ssse3 () from /usr/lib64/libswscale.so.3
[16:53:47] <zetok> so, yeah.
[16:54:26] <Encrypt> Ok
[17:00:26] <zetok> Encrypt: would your friend mind making an issue?
[17:00:39] <Encrypt> zetok, I'll tell him :)
