[14:16:24] <High_Priest> zetok, I grabbed the one from the website.. 
[14:16:33] <zetok> wrong website too
[14:16:35] <zetok> ;)
[14:17:51] <zetok> High_Priest: link to homepage is in the topic :)

[14:18:57] <High_Priest> I first found this page: https://tox.chat/about.html
[14:19:05] <High_Priest> is it not related to this project?
[14:19:55] <High_Priest> then I added a repo from there (which didn't work) and _then_ I came here to ask
[14:20:06] <zetok> related ≠ qTox website
[14:21:30] <High_Priest> so it is related, but only contains wrong/not updated information? 
[14:22:18] <zetok> ~mostly
[14:23:08] <High_Priest> okay, I kind of get it now
[14:23:13] * zetok haven't seen about page before though
[14:23:23] <zetok> gotta say, there's plenty of bullshit on it
[14:23:25] <High_Priest> anyways, it's working fine
[14:23:33] <High_Priest> so thanks :)
[14:23:44] <zetok> you're welcome :)

[17:07:19] <cisc> on KDE the qTox tray icon is the XEmbed type, whereas newer Plasma5 DE went to SNI, if I got that right. so if xembedsniproxy gets killed the qTox icon will go away. Any plan to move to the new framework or whatever?
[17:07:50] <zetok> is it still broken?
[17:08:11] <zetok> https://github.com/tux3/qTox/wiki/Tray-icon ← might want to read the note at the bottom
[17:08:47] <cisc> it works fine, but some apps are using the new SNI way, others are not
[17:09:39] <cisc> ok nevermind, I killed xembedxniproxy and the qtox icon is still there. so it got fixed @ some point

[18:30:02] <Saaaam_> zetok: could you tell me when you have time if the language menu for the website is good with the browsers you use? (good = the flag and "EN" on the same line + no hidden columns)
[18:30:40] *** Joins: st4ll1 (~st4ll1@ )
[18:31:28] <zetok> Saaaam_: history needs to be rewritten a bit
[18:32:46] <Saaaam_> History... What do you mean by history?
[18:35:10] <zetok> Saaaam_: https://github.com/Saaaam/qtox_website_test/compare/cf7f01af3af31c5f52c343ec29893d4ef45c74ea...menu-top-add
[18:36:42] <zetok> Saaaam_: basically, you'd want to do `git checkout cf7f01af3af31c5f52c343ec29893d4ef45c74ea -b top-lags` and add on top of that only needed changes
[18:37:39] <zetok> Saaaam_: btw, presence/absence of hidden columns depends on how much zoomed the website is
