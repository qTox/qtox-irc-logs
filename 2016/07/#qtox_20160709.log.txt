[12:37:34] <Saaaam> Hello everybody :)
[12:42:32] <zetok> hello Saaaam :)
[12:42:47] <Saaaam> zetok: o/
[12:44:39] <Saaaam> When you'll have some free time, could you tell me what should I do to help you implement the functionnality with the languages menu on top for the website? ^^
[12:50:44] <zetok> um
[12:51:18] <zetok> in a moment
[12:57:00] <zetok> Saaaam: I wonder if it should be integrated
[12:58:53] <zetok> Saaaam: i.e. it has to work
[12:59:58] <Saaaam> You're totally right
[13:00:20] <zetok> the stuff you did with CSS is really awesome
[13:00:39] <Saaaam> But if I can do anything more to make it work, I'll try to do it
[13:00:57] <zetok> basically the language columns
[13:01:51] <zetok> i.e. is it possible to dynamically allocate them in CSS?
[13:02:03] <zetok> otherwise it is going to cause problems
[13:02:15] <Saaaam> I can increase the height of the columns if not all the languages are displayed
[13:02:22] <zetok> I see
[13:02:30] <zetok> I have an idea, but it won't use CSS
[13:03:32] <zetok> i.e. to use lang icon on top to link to the bottom language section
[13:04:00] <Saaaam> Right
[13:04:18] <Saaaam> That should do the trick
[13:05:08] <zetok> ok
[13:06:41] <Saaaam> You want to make it as a link for all the screens, or only for small screens?
[13:06:54] <zetok> um?
[13:07:47] <zetok> is there a reason to not do that?
[13:08:14] <zetok> oh
[13:08:31] <zetok> it's not about screen size, since the issue is reproducible regardless of that
[13:09:09] <zetok> i.e. it depends on zoom in browser, which can have different values
[13:09:17] <zetok> regardless of screen size
[13:09:27] <Saaaam> There's no reason indeed ;)  But as with CSS, you can display things in different ways according to the different kind of screen sizes (using media-queries), it is also a possible solution
[13:10:13] <zetok> I like what works
[13:10:19] <Saaaam> Hum... no, nevermind, it's more complicated than your solution: a simple link, and it works for everyone
[13:10:23] <zetok> if it will work, why not
[13:10:29] *** Quits: sudden6 (~anonymous@ ) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[13:13:28] <Saaaam> Let's make it a simple link?
[13:13:55] <zetok> flag + link
[13:14:07] <zetok> :)
[13:14:15] <zetok> perhaps in reverse order
[13:15:01] <Saaaam> To be clear, I was thinking to make the whole "flag + EN" as a link, is it your idea too?
[13:15:55] <zetok> yep :)
[13:16:14] <zetok> btw, could you rename flags to the lang codes?
[13:16:34] *** Joins: Chiitoo (~Chiitoo@ )
[13:16:48] <Saaaam> like "en.png", "it.png", etc. ?
[13:16:50] <zetok> Zend locale name, that is
[13:17:00] <Saaaam> okay, I can do that ;)
[13:17:19] <zetok> thanks
[13:17:51] <zetok> hmm
[13:18:04] <zetok> also
[13:18:07] <Saaaam> Yup?
[13:18:42] <zetok> Saaaam: rather than using "EN", use "[[[Language]]]"
[13:18:56] <Saaaam> Okay, good idea
[13:19:06] <zetok> hum
[13:20:26] * zetok wonders if `{{{lang_shortcode}}}` would work
[13:20:54] <Saaaam> But how to change the flag according to the selected language? I mean, okay, the flag will be named "it.png" for example for Italy. But now the aim is to display the good flag according to the selected language. Does a "[[[Language]]].png" in the code could do the trick?
[13:21:08] <zetok> i.e. `assets/imgs/flags/{{{lang_shortcode}}}.png`
[13:21:12] <Saaaam> oh
[13:21:21] <Saaaam> Yeah, that's what I meant
[13:21:25] <Saaaam> We can try
[13:21:34] <zetok> Saaaam: no, it would get replaced with value from .json, e.g. https://github.com/Saaaam/qtox_website_test/blob/top-langs/index.hu.json#L3
[13:22:19] <Saaaam> I see what you mean, let's try with lang_shortcode 
[13:22:37] <zetok> probably won't get replaced
[13:23:02] <zetok> or maybe it will
[13:23:04] <zetok> dunno :s
[13:23:05] <Saaaam> (I have something quick to do away from the computer, be right back in few minuts)
[13:23:11] <zetok> np :)
[13:23:21] <Saaaam> If we'll never try, we'll never know ;)
[13:26:30] <zetok> yeah :)
[13:26:48] <zetok> if it won't work, then it'll just mean that "lang_shortcode" will need to be added to json files
[13:27:09] * zetok wonders whether writing a script that would add it to json would be faster than adding it manually
[13:54:12] <Saaaam> I have to help someone for few hours. I'll keep working on it just after
[14:03:14] <koshii> zetok: linuxmodder: Debian 8 Jessie, i386
