[20:44:09] <toweI> what is the purpose of this rtaudio thing?
[20:55:43] *** Joins: sudden6 (~anonymous@ )
[21:05:47] <zetok> fixing stuff that can't be fixed because openal
[21:06:35] <zetok> after fixes, with RtAudio it should be possible to make filter_audio work properly
[21:36:28] <toweI> oh so openal was the reason why this never worked?
[21:37:10] <zetok> kinda
[21:37:26] <zetok> AFAIK it just doesn't provide needed info
[21:37:38] <zetok> + there are unicode problems with device names
[21:38:11] <zetok> RtAudio is supposed to do both of those things
[21:39:23] <zetok> ><zetok> AFAIK it just doesn't provide needed info
[21:39:46] <zetok> irungentoo made a patch for openal with this, but it doesn't look like it was ever merged by upstream, so.
[21:43:07] <toweI> I was using his openal fork. it did not change a thing
[21:44:47] <zetok> yep, it's not supposed to
[21:45:55] <zetok> openal is(?) still used, only at some later point it will be removed in favour of RtAudio, when RtAudio side will have at least feature parity
[21:46:23] <zetok> (it's written in the PR description)
[21:51:15] <toweI> I hope it has a better device managment than opanAl. openal wasted cpu time by letting devices open and sending empty sound or something
[21:52:58] <zetok> dunno, hopefully

[22:04:17] <Saaaam> Hello everyone ^^
[22:06:29] <Saaaam> Simple question: I do have a friend who has a tablet, and we want to install the best Tox software, where developpers though about tablet users while they developped the software. I don't know if qTox is appropriated for that or if I shoul tell her to use another Tox software? :3
[22:10:38] <Emcy_> qtox is on tablets?
[22:11:35] <zetok> Saaaam: if android, use Antox
[22:12:29] <Saaaam> Thanks ;)
[22:13:11] <zetok> Saaaam: btw, https://a.uguu.se/B7CINNAVR1iN.png
[22:14:49] <Saaaam> hum... not good... :/
[22:15:52] <Saaaam> I can't work on it right now, I do have some PHP problems to fix for work for tomorrow (gonna spent the night on it >.< )
[22:16:05] <Saaaam> But I keep this in mind, don't worry ;)
[22:18:05] <zetok> no problem, there's no hurry :)
