[11:31:21] <Diadlo> zetok: Can you test #3531 again?)
[11:31:45] <Diadlo> https://github.com/tux3/qTox/pull/3531
[11:46:03] <zetok> Diadlo: now it's back to crashing
[11:46:10] <zetok> want bt?
[11:47:19] <Diadlo> If not the same, lets see
[11:48:18] <zetok> https://gist.github.com/zetok/b8ea453ae3b5207ff0f2e515c77a6f13 seems to be the same
[11:48:48] <Diadlo> No. I don't understand, why it stop crashing before
[11:53:07] <Diadlo> Hm... Seems, now without warning?
[11:55:40] <zetok> yep
[12:11:36] <Diadlo> zetok: Can you send your /var/tmp/portage/media-video/ffmpeg-2.8.6/work/ffmpeg-2.8.6/libswscale/swscale.c and /var/tmp/portage/media-video/ffmpeg-2.8.6/work/ffmpeg-2.8.6/libswscale/hscale.c or link to download this sources?
[12:14:26] <zetok> um, I don't have them
[12:15:57] <Diadlo> Hm.. It's strange
[12:16:48] <zetok> if needed, I could emerge with `installsources`, but those files should be unmodified ffmpeg source
[12:19:13] <zetok> Diadlo: https://ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-2.8.6.tar.xz
[12:22:44] <Diadlo> Thank you
