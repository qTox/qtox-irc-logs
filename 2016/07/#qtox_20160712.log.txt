[08:09:49] <cisc> ouch!
[08:09:54] <cisc> *door slams*
[08:11:46] <cisc> well should I add to it? I am not the one with the rotten apple system, a friend is. not sure what else I could add

[08:19:02] <anoa> Weird how it never happened on my OSX VM.
[08:19:14] <anoa> But it did constantly on my macbook.
[08:19:35] <anoa> Keystroke eating I mean -the other mac issue.
[08:21:32] <cisc> VM may have different behaviour than on bare metal
[08:27:10] <cisc> so on OS X Sierra on the Audio/Video tab if you set the audio devices to anything other than "no device" qtox crashes
[08:33:35] <zetok> cisc: mind opening an issue about the crash?
[08:34:38] <zetok> (I'm not sure if it won't be a duplicate, but I can't find anything)
[08:35:08] <cisc> yeah ill try to get more info from my friend, maybe there's something in the logs
[08:36:56] <cisc> and where OS X stores the log file for qtox I don't know
[08:38:07] <zetok> ~/.cache/Tox/qTox
[08:40:48] <cisc> wasn't that path moved?
[08:44:04] <cisc> on my Linux box there isn't ~/.cache/Tox/qTox
