[00:21:05] <Diadlo> Problem exist with this config, right?
[00:21:49] <zetok> I think so
[00:22:07] <zetok> i.e. that should be the relevant part of the config
[00:22:31] <Diadlo> Yes, I think too, but can you test it?
[00:22:39] <zetok> "test" ?
[00:22:51] <zetok> i.e. manually edit and see what will happen?
[00:23:03] <Diadlo> Yes
[00:23:23] <Diadlo> Setup this config and try crash
[00:23:33] <Diadlo> *try to
[00:26:21] <zetok> with `.0` added at the end it seems to work
[00:26:54] <Diadlo> And without -- don't?
[00:26:58] <zetok> yep
[00:27:29] <Diadlo> Can you set `videoDev=asdasd` ?
[00:27:46] <Diadlo> And check this out
[00:29:24] <zetok> crashes
[00:29:29] <Diadlo> Wow
[00:30:04] <Diadlo> Ok. And what about `videoDev=none`?
[00:31:52] <Diadlo> You can setup it from settings
[00:32:08] <Diadlo> I think
[00:32:15] <zetok> crashes
[00:32:24] <Diadlo> "Super"
[00:32:59] <Diadlo> This issue absolutely not related with screen stream
[00:33:22] <Diadlo> Can you change it on GH?
[00:33:43] <zetok> hm?
[00:34:29] <Diadlo> Doesn't matter)

[01:00:40] <Diadlo> zetok: With regular settings video call with "None" device causes problems?
[01:18:51] <zetok> yep
[01:20:23] <Diadlo> Ok. Now, when we know, that 294bdab77f8fb6c2b29917f5318ffe4ec2bc2ab6 just provoked bug, but not the reason of it, can you find broken commit?
[01:20:35] <Diadlo> zetok: ↑
[01:21:00] <zetok> hmm
[01:21:02] <Diadlo> Offtop: How you write '↑' without copy-paste?
[01:22:29] <zetok> ralt + shift + u
[01:25:25] <zetok> perhaps s/ralt/compose key/
[01:26:08] <zetok> compose:rwin
[01:26:29] <zetok> ↑ this `setxkbmap` option
[01:26:58] <Diadlo> Thanks

[01:43:52] <Diadlo> zetok: How long, typically, goes search?
[01:43:59] <Diadlo> *commit search
[01:44:17] <zetok> >Bisecting: 0 revisions left to test after this (roughly 0 steps)
[01:44:19] <zetok> :P
[01:44:39] <zetok> 1-2 min per revision
[01:44:57] <Diadlo> > Bisecting: 0 revisions left to test after this (roughly 0 steps)
[01:45:11] <Diadlo> Does it means, that you found?
[01:45:49] <zetok> https://github.com/tux3/qTox/issues/3527#issuecomment-234688481
[01:46:01] <zetok> I think so
[01:46:43] <zetok> i.e. after bisect finds the commit that introduced bug, one should test with the commit reverted, to check if reverting would help
[01:49:27] <zetok> and yep, reverting helps
[01:49:51] <Diadlo> Cool
[01:53:25] <zetok> now that I look at it, it would seem that it takes ~5 min per revision :s
[01:54:08] <Diadlo> Let's try https://github.com/tux3/qTox/pull/3534

[20:28:52] <BiTOk> hello. why qtox doesn't moved to cmake or other modern build system?
[20:33:58] <Diadl0> CMake generates platform specific make files
[20:34:17] <Diadl0> qmake -- not
[20:34:41] <BiTOk> are you tried to build qtox on windows?
[20:34:55] <Diadl0> Not
[20:34:59] <BiTOk> :-)
[20:35:40] <BiTOk> my last attempt took about 2 days
