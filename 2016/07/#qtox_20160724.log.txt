[11:55:19] * zetok wonders
[11:55:49] <zetok> if people could compile qTox on osx, there'd be no problem
[11:56:04] <zetok> since if they wanted a fix before 1.5 release, they could just compile master
[11:56:20] <BiTOk> Hello. Is anybody know why libsodium and some other dependences aren't in windows\bootstrap.sh?
[11:56:32] <zetok> but since compiling on osx broke, I'm not even sure if osx people will get 1.5
[11:56:44] <Diadlo> zetok: But it's differen issue
[11:56:45] <zetok> BiTOk: no idea

[13:41:36] <zetok> Diadlo: as for the newest xp issue, I doubt whether we need to do anything
[13:42:17] <Diadlo> I think, it easy to fix
[13:42:39] <sudden6> zetok: which ones specifically ;)
[13:42:58] <zetok> sudden6: video crash one
[13:43:13] <zetok> Diadlo: err
[13:43:20] <Diadlo> Why?
[13:43:44] <Diadlo> Just add another condition like `qWinVersion() == WV_XP`
[13:43:54] <zetok> no
[13:43:57] <Diadlo> Why?
[13:43:58] <zetok> completely unnecessary
[13:44:33] <zetok> also, there's no need to change something that works to something that will break stuff for all xp users, or introduce code that will require maintaining, and will be only used by xp
[13:44:45] <sudden6> Diadlo: shouldn't it be possible to get the path from some qt environment api?
[13:46:49] <Diadlo> sudden6: I don't know, but now for Windows we use partial hardcoded path
[13:47:16] <Diadlo> QStandardPaths::writableLocation(QStandardPaths::HomeLocation) + QDir::separator() + "AppData" + ...
[13:48:09] <sudden6> yeah, maybe there's a direct way to %AppData% ?
[13:48:18] <sudden6> would be more future proof
[13:48:56] <Diadlo> Does anybody try to use "%AppData%" in qt?
[13:49:34] <sudden6> no idea, but I heard using %appdata% isn't always a good idea
[13:49:37] <Diadlo> QStandardPaths::AppDataLocation
[13:49:39] <Diadlo> Wow
[13:49:44] <Diadlo> It exist :)
[13:49:53] <sudden6> that's what I thought :)
[13:51:47] <Diadlo> > This enum value was added in Qt 5.4.
[13:51:49] <Diadlo> :(
[13:51:54] <sudden6> ah, crap
[13:52:30] <zetok> Diadlo: why would you think that breaking stuff is a good idea?
[13:54:01] <Diadlo> zetok: If microsoft decides that it would be cool rename "AppData" to "AppDataNew" we will have problems
[13:54:23] <zetok> err, nope
[13:54:41] <zetok> this is not the case
[13:55:14] <Diadlo> AppDataLocation seems cross platform
[13:55:29] <Diadlo> Ie means, that we can do some code cleanup

[14:07:11] <sudden6> it makes the ui load immediately the same as your version
[14:07:27] <Diadlo> Hm...
[14:07:38] <sudden6> but it crashes if I switch tabs, not sure if I implemented it right though
[14:08:15] <Diadlo> I add mutex in (un)subscribe
[14:08:40] <Diadlo> May be it's reason?
[14:08:49] <sudden6> probably yes
[14:09:59] <sudden6> could you post you code somewhere for comparison?
[14:10:27] <Diadlo> I can push it. It will be normal?

[14:18:37] <Diadlo> I try without mutex. Still blocks

[14:25:12] <Diadlo> It work to me for few video modes
[14:29:00] <sudden6> Diadlo: I have no idea why your first solution works, but the current one doesn't...
[14:29:18] <sudden6> theoretically it should work
[14:29:44] <Diadlo> Yes, in theory
[14:30:27] <Diadlo> sudden6: For you my last solution works fine?
[14:31:30] <sudden6> wait a moment, didn't notice you changed again
[14:31:56] <Diadlo> I just remove mutex
[14:32:16] <sudden6> nope, segfaults if I switch tab
[14:32:57] <Diadlo> But first loading have no UI freezes?
[14:33:18] <sudden6> yes
[14:33:32] <Diadlo> But I have
[14:33:39] <Diadlo> wtf?
[14:33:55] <sudden6> maybe it's two issues?
[14:34:24] <Diadlo> Maybe
[14:34:32] <sudden6> for me it's definitely setSource which causes the delay
[14:34:53] <Diadlo> Wow
[14:35:38] <Diadlo> I move only `subscribe()` in `QtConcurrent::run` and it avoid of crashes
[14:36:06] <Diadlo> But sill freez for some modes
[14:36:09] <Diadlo> *freeze
[14:37:49] <sudden6> wait, it still freezes for another mode for me too
[14:39:20] <Diadlo> Ok. I came later and try again
[14:40:10] <sudden6> huh? I don't understand what you'r trying to say^^

[23:21:23] <Diadlo> Will be cool have this
[23:21:40] <BiTOk> can jenkins build it?

[23:21:59] * zetok shrugs
[23:22:38] <Diadlo> Why?
[23:22:39] <BiTOk> maybe tux3 can configure it?
[23:23:18] <zetok> Diadlo: tox.chat people decided that they can't trust me
[23:23:38] <Diadlo> WAT? -_-
[23:23:59] <Diadlo> Ok
[23:24:19] <BiTOk> observed some problems with many pr's, they often break good code
[23:24:26] <zetok> BiTOk: yeah
[23:24:46] <BiTOk> there is a need to strengthen testing
[23:24:46] <Diadlo> If we will have all PR build in jenkins, many people can easly test it
[23:24:56] <zetok> as for tux3 configuring stuff, I wouldn't count on this, since he doesn't have enough time for stuff
[23:25:06] <zetok> we won't
[23:25:43] <BiTOk> but without regular autobuilds it is not possible
[23:25:57] * zetok wonders
[23:26:15] <zetok> thing is, building every PR & getting build artifacts would be possible via travis
[23:26:21] <zetok> (kinda)
[23:26:26] <zetok> (in a way)
[23:26:42] <zetok> the problem is, where those binaries will be stored?
[23:27:00] <Diadlo> qtox.github.io ?
[23:27:02] <zetok> i.e. that's *a lot* of space, basically new binary for each new push to any of PRs
[23:27:05] <zetok> nope
[23:27:15] <Diadlo> Why?
[23:27:17] <zetok> that's hosted by github, and they have 1GB limit
[23:27:22] <zetok> "limit"
[23:27:42] <zetok> they nicely ask you to not have "websites" bigger than 1GB
[23:27:53] <zetok> (same goes for repo size)

[23:44:36] <Diadlo> Right?
[23:44:53] <zetok> yes, but that isn't the best option
[23:45:17] <zetok> since first you'd need to configure travis in a way that would result in builds that are usable
[23:46:31] <zetok> also, this would make travis build times way longer than they're now
[23:46:51] <Diadlo> Ok. I understand
[23:48:49] <Diadlo> Adding automatic test make build longer too
[23:50:10] <zetok> not that much
