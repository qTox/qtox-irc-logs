[08:34:14] <zetok> zero-ghost: unless it's a security fix, no can do :f
[08:34:29] <zero-ghost> hmm
[08:34:53] <zetok> there are 2 parts
[08:35:01] <zetok> 1. is someone who would code it
[08:35:08] <zetok> 2. is someone to review and merge
[08:35:22] <zetok> actually, 3rd part is deployment
[08:35:37] <zero-ghost> i know youre pro enough to do all those things cause these are 2 little things ive mentioned a few times over the past year
[08:35:43] <zetok> which too isn't really happening for osx & windows until 1.5 gets released
[08:35:56] <zero-ghost> ability to select rectangle area for desktop sharing

[08:36:37] <zero-ghost> simple and needed!
[08:36:38] <zero-ghost> by me
[08:36:45] <zetok> dunno about "simple"

[08:37:11] <zetok> ;D
[08:37:36] <zero-ghost> 1 SDC = 20 cents right now

[08:40:13] <zero-ghost> damn it, i will
[08:40:30] <zero-ghost> look at that last random commenter, even HE says it should be "trivial" to implement
[08:40:37] <zero-ghost> now i know that guy knows what hes talking about
[08:41:35] <zetok> yes, very often people unfamiliar with coding/codebase think that visually small things ought to be easy to code
[08:42:22] <zero-ghost> the customer is always right!

[09:50:56] <Chiitoo> aouert: A current version has an option to increase the chat font-size, under General/Chat.  Not sure if that's on the official Windows builds yet though.
[09:51:47] <Chiitoo> If not, you'll probably need to wait for a while more, or build it yourself.  ^^
[09:54:34] <aouert> Chiitoo: I do not see that option :(

[09:56:47] <Chiitoo> OK yeah, thought so.
[09:58:19] <aouert> ok, thanks for the info
[09:58:27] <aouert> is there an ETA?
[10:00:12] <Emcy> i tried the nightly with the text size option
[10:00:19] <Emcy> font too. its good
[10:00:38] <Emcy> crashes video though so back to stable for me
[10:01:23] <Chiitoo> Would be nice for some if the size of the font for the typing area could be changed as well.  ^^
[10:06:17] <aouert> Chiitoo: are you saying that 1.5 will not be able to change the font size for the actual chat text? That's the most important size!

[10:43:00] <zetok> ok
[10:44:03] <zetok> Emcy: there was a small fix to video crash a few days ago, you might want to retest with newest nightly; if it will still crash, it would be good to make an issue, so that it could be fixed before 1.5

[14:44:41] <Emcy> do you think theres anything qtox can do to push ahead with the iframe bug
[14:46:05] <Emcy> i think it was with toxcore maybe.....but still. Its one relatively simple (i think) fix that would make video much more usable
[14:47:34] <Emcy> its been there since A/V was released. My regular video contact knows not to move their phone around on call becuase the video explodes into confetti until the next iframe which is sometimes like over 10 seconds
[14:52:11] <Emcy> https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/issues/1479 allright it was actually tux3 who opened the issue......

[17:38:30] <SkyzohKey> instead of being rude, explain your opinion plz
[17:38:36] <zetok> what you should ask, yourself first: "what is not wrong with it?"
[17:38:52] <zetok> SkyzohKey: layout & font
[17:39:08] <SkyzohKey> how the layout is wrong ?
[17:39:38] <zetok> what is layout supposed to achieve?
[17:39:48] <SkyzohKey> login screen
[17:39:53] <zetok> bullshit
[17:40:30] <zetok> if you wanted to achieve "login screen" you'd just have 2 fields, one for login, other one for password, with an optional button to log-in, and nothing more
[17:40:42] <zetok> so, what is the purpose of layout?
[17:40:49] <SkyzohKey> login screen, again.
[17:41:08] <SkyzohKey> You know, design matters in applications
[17:41:13] <zetok> then you don't need layout, remove everything & just leave 2 fields
[17:41:20] <zetok> yes, and you don't have the design there
[17:41:27] <SkyzohKey> and it'll looks ugly
[17:41:40] <zetok> that's what you've said you want to achieve
[17:41:54] <SkyzohKey> That's already what i achieved
[17:41:59] <SkyzohKey> the avatar changes whether the user choose another profile
[17:42:03] <zetok> ugly look?
[17:42:07] <zetok> if you say so.
[17:42:13] <SkyzohKey> and if profile has no avatar, it use the tox default one
[17:42:35] <SkyzohKey> what is wrong with the design in your opinion ?
[17:42:45] <zetok> I've already said
[17:42:50] <zetok> layout & font

[19:51:50] <SkyzohKey> emojis are correctly configured
[19:51:58] <SkyzohKey> the way qTox handle them is badly coded

[19:52:30] <zetok> yes, precisely in this context ;)
[19:52:44] <SkyzohKey> the code is bad, not my fault
[19:52:53] <zetok> code works as expected
[19:53:22] <SkyzohKey> lel no
[19:53:27] <SkyzohKey> just look at the screenshot
[19:53:32] <zetok> i.e. if there's no spaces around them, they're not parsed as emoticons
[19:53:33] <SkyzohKey> i just pasted some unicode emojis
[19:53:39] <SkyzohKey> so your code is broken
[19:53:42] <zetok> and currently they're expected to work like that
[19:53:48] <SkyzohKey> that's stupid so
[19:54:05] <zetok> dunno about that
[19:54:09] <SkyzohKey> why couldn't an user get proper emoji if he doesn't want to space them ?
[19:54:32] <zetok> user doesn't care, and user can't type emojis in anyway
[19:54:42] <zetok> and emoji picker is supposed to put spaces along with the emoji
[19:54:47] <SkyzohKey> alt+1 gives you emoji
[19:55:08] <SkyzohKey> + qTox isn't the only client, if other clients doesn't put spaces, then qTox render is broken
[19:55:21] <zetok> >other clients
[19:55:24] <zetok> what other clients?
[19:55:50] <zetok> right, antidote and Antox
[19:55:56] <SkyzohKey> uTox, Ricin, Toxygen, gTox, etc
[19:56:18] <SkyzohKey> I'm not in cause if you refuse to do things the right way eh.
[19:59:57] <zetok> SkyzohKey: um, when you're going to make an issue?

[20:01:33] <zetok> please SkyzohKey
[20:02:16] <zetok> if you want to troll at least do it with a class
[20:21:17] <Chiitoo> Indeed, if there's something wrong about that behaviour, SkyzohKey, I don't see why you wouldn't create an 'issue' for others to see it, too.  :]

[22:12:55] *** Joins: abbat (~Anton@ )
[22:12:56] <cisc> yes, removing it is a good idea
[22:13:09] <Chiitoo> Open an issue, perhaps, for a vote of sorts.  :]
[22:13:35] <cisc> i wonder if anyone actually wants that? I think people are smart enough to know where the text input box is
[22:13:42] <zetok> nope

[22:16:39] <zetok> ↑ how I test qTox
[22:18:16] <Chiitoo> I'm not sure testing for such users is a good use of time, but as long as you enjoy that time spent, it shouldn't be a waste.  :]
[22:19:08] <zetok> it is
[22:19:36] <zetok> i.e. usually people test things for the expected way in which something is /supposed/ to work
[22:19:56] *** Joins: VVD (~VVD@ )
[22:20:03] <Chiitoo> But have you had any user ask you where to enter their message at?
[22:20:09] <Chiitoo> I mean I get your point, yes.
[22:20:16] <zetok> and the remaining, mostly untested part, is using software the way it is not supposed to be used, and that's where most of bugs that affect normal use-cases hides
[22:20:18] <Chiitoo> But in this specific case, you're sure it's needed?
[22:20:29] <zetok> yes
[22:20:36] <Chiitoo> Do you have an example for me?
[22:21:33] <zetok> early stages of alzheimer, and generally old people who are new to the software
[22:22:21] <zetok> having a field that says "type message here" is really helpful
[22:22:29] <Chiitoo> Okay.  I imagine they would have a lot of other difficulties aside from this to use the application, but I can imagine that.
[22:23:09] <zetok> yes, they do have lots of other difficulties, but if at least this could be made less difficult..
[22:23:28] <Chiitoo> s/can imagine that/can imagine that too/
[22:23:31] <cisc> no email client i've ever seen says "Type your message here..."
[22:23:40] <cisc> and old people seem to know where to type
[22:24:11] <Chiitoo> Well we have at least one 'pro' here, what's your 'nay'?  :]
[22:24:12] <zetok> cisc: yes, one you explain it to them, and preferably repeat process a few times
[22:24:17] <zetok> once*
[22:24:19] <cisc> if someone has alzhemers and needs "TYpe your message here..." they have a lot of other problems that will prevent them from ever getting it installed
[22:24:53] <zetok> err
[22:25:18] <zetok> who installs software is irrelevant in this context
[22:25:24] <cisc> why not make it in big bold letters "TYPE YOUR MESSAGE HERE" then
[22:25:31] <cisc> maybe that will help even more
[22:25:43] <linuxmodder> or an accessibility mode with that 
[22:25:46] <cisc> there could be a few people that couldn't see the lighter text
[22:25:53] <Chiitoo> cisc: What is your specific reason to want it gone?
[22:26:00] <zetok> cisc: if you think that this would be more helpful, make an issue proposing this :)
[22:26:05] <cisc> Chiitoo: to me it's just needless, if not annoying
[22:26:08] <Chiitoo> An accessibility mode could be a thing in the future, why not.
[22:26:35] <Chiitoo> If it's just 'annoying', I'm not sure I'd go for removing it from the disabled based on just that.
[22:26:43] <zetok> https://github.com/tux3/qTox/milestone/1 ← it's really bad :(
[22:26:47] <Chiitoo> You could simply compile your custom version, too, without it.
[22:26:52] <linuxmodder> cisc,  skype and the like do tho :( not defending the use there but ...
[22:27:23] <zetok> and the worst part is that I couldn't even get accessibility stuff to even work with qt5 so that I could test & open new issues; dunno perhaps I was doing something wrong :(
[22:27:31] <Chiitoo> linuxmodder: Do what?  
[22:27:52] <linuxmodder> Chiitoo,  while  simple_make.sh is great  its not very interactively out the box for that thus  limiting userbase
[22:28:28] <Chiitoo> I mean what Skype and the like do tho?  Not sure at which point that was to.  :D
[22:28:38] <cisc> well skype has many annoying things about it, if it says "Type your message here" that is the least of its problems
[22:29:15] <Chiitoo> linuxmodder: Oh and yeah, sure, I didn't mean just anyone will go and compile things for themselves.
[22:29:23] <Chiitoo> But if they hate a feature that much...  :]
[22:29:41] <cisc> Chiitoo: do you think it's needed or should be an option?
[22:29:42] <Chiitoo> And if Skype has that 'type here' thing too, is that the web app version?
[22:29:52] <cisc> I just checked on the web version and it doesn't have it
[22:29:56] <cisc> so it's probably just the app version
[22:29:58] <Chiitoo> A friend just mentioned a while ago that Skype doesn't have that.  (Does it have an option for it?)
[22:30:46] <linuxmodder> it may have removed it fully then since I last used that crapware then 
[22:30:55] <cisc> actually I'm wrong, the web version does have it
[22:31:06] <cisc> but it goes away, the message, when the cursor is placed in the text input box
[22:31:07] <Chiitoo> As a single option I think it seems a bit much for such a thing, but if there were to be more accessibility options, maybe then.
[22:31:13] <cisc> that would be a happy medium for qtox
[22:31:23] <cisc> when cursor is in text box, have the message disappear
[22:31:47] <zetok> ><cisc> but it goes away, the message, when the cursor is placed in the text input box
[22:31:50] <Chiitoo> Ah, that could be a middle ground maybe.
[22:31:54] <zetok> cisc: it works like that
[22:32:03] <cisc> zetok: not on my system
[22:32:16] <cisc> in regards to qtox
[22:32:18] <zetok> cisc: https://github.com/tux3/qTox/issues/3230
[22:32:32] <zetok> ?
[22:32:38] <cisc> yep thats it
[22:32:46] <cisc> its still not fixed..
[22:33:08] <cisc> but i'm not using Japanese chars
[22:33:42] <zetok> but you're not "just" typing on a real™ keyboard, right?
[22:33:54] <cisc> ok we're not on the same page
[22:34:06] <zetok> oh
[22:34:08] * zetok got it
[22:34:11] <cisc> I am suggesting that the message goes away as soon as the cursor is in the text box
[22:34:44] <Chiitoo> Yeah, the message doesn't go away even if the window is active, and the input field is selected.
[22:35:07] <zetok> I guess that would do
[22:35:24] <Chiitoo> That's how it might work on most websites too, on search fields etc.
[22:35:27] <cisc> that may even provide more context for people
[22:35:36] <Chiitoo> Except for youtube, it seems.
[22:35:55] <Chiitoo> But yes, it can help seeing that the thing is indeed selected.
[22:36:01] <cisc> agree
[22:36:13] <Chiitoo> I know I've typed a whiles to qTox while it wasn't actually the active window.  :E
[22:36:49] <cisc> and that was after a long party night maybe
[22:37:10] <Chiitoo> Not even.
[22:40:15] <zetok> cisc: ok, added comment, thanks :)
[22:40:47] <cisc> zetok: looks good, np

[23:05:30] <SkyzohKey> <cisc> but it goes away, the message, when the cursor is placed in the text input box
[23:05:35] <SkyzohKey> that's called a placeholder
[23:09:25] <cisc> SkyzohKey: how do you have it set up in your client?
[23:10:06] <SkyzohKey> <textarea name="chatview-entry" placeholder="Type your message here..."></textarea>
[23:10:28] <SkyzohKey> and in Ricin: this.entry.placeholder = "Type your message here...";
[23:11:47] <SkyzohKey> It should work like: Until user write something in the input, placeholder is displayed, once user start to type, placeholder is hided, if the user empty the input, placeholder goes back
[23:14:09] *** Joins: LittleVulpix (~Miranda@ )
[23:14:11] <cisc> that's how qtox currently is
[23:14:31] <SkyzohKey> nice then
[23:14:49] <SkyzohKey> why would someone wants an useful information to be removed ?
[23:18:20] <cisc> makes more sense for the placeholder message to go away when cursor is placed in text input box
