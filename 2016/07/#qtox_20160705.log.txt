[10:23:47] <nurupo> what about pushing to weblate?

[11:17:28] <zetok> nurupo: there is a script, but I don't use it
[11:22:10] <zetok> I just cherry-pick all the commits without merges, clean up files (with a script) and push that to qTox master, after which I just reset weblate to master, since cleaning up files causes conflicts
[11:23:52] <zetok> dunno about user management

[13:33:24] <Saamm> Hello eveyone
[13:33:27] <Saamm> every* one
[13:35:20] <Saamm> I've finally finished to implement the language change on top on localhost, this is the first step. The next step is to learn how to create a branch (I'll read tutorials for that), and to put the file I've created on the server
[13:36:10] <Saamm> (sorry about the lag, btw. I'm not in my home these days, I'm at a friend's, and it's quite difficult to work with the whole family and everything...)
[13:38:56] <Saamm> (or if you want it quicker, I can send the file index.mustache to someone who will be able to create a branch, fix what's gonna need a fix, and send back the file)
[13:41:30] <Saamm> Note that what I've done can be improved; as I'm not used to the whole git websites system, python files, etc., if there's a new language added, it'll be necessary to manually add some corrections. The best thing would be a direct update if new languages are added...

[14:25:25] <Chiitoo> Saamm: Which changes are those?  I can't find a related issue open nor think of any Python specific thing we have going.  Makes me think of #pylib (for Tox: generic virtualenv management and test command line tool).
[14:25:54] <Saamm> Chiitoo: https://github.com/qTox/qTox-Website/issues/2
[14:26:09] <Chiitoo> Ah.
[14:26:11] <Chiitoo> Thanks.
[14:31:54] *** Joins: abbat (~abbat@ )
[14:32:06] <Saamm> According to https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#branch, when the button "Branch: master" is clicked, a input field allow the user to search for a branch, OR to create a new branch. When I'm trying this on the qTox website repository, I can only search for branchs (while I want to open a new branch). Am I doing something wrong? Oo
[14:33:24] <Saamm> Chiitoo: by the way, I talked about Python because "Building the site requires Python 2 or Python 3 and the pystache library."  ;)
[14:33:49] <Chiitoo> Yeah, I haven't looked into the website at all yet.
[14:33:58] <Chiitoo> Didn't even think of it.
[14:35:04] <Chiitoo> And indeed, you would need permission to the repository to be able to create branches.
[14:35:06] <Saamm> My bad, I did not say explicitely I was talking about the website ^^"
[14:35:36] <Chiitoo> It's fine.  My fault for not thinking of it!
[14:36:07] <zetok> Saamm: make a fork
[14:36:32] <Chiitoo> You probably want to fork the repository instead, then create the branch in your own github page.
[14:36:54] <Saamm> I tried that too 2 minuts ago
[14:37:06] <Saamm> But I still can't create a branch >.<
[14:37:23] <Saamm> https://github.com/Saaaam/qtox_website_test
[14:37:41] <Saamm> Okay, I said nothing...
[14:37:46] <Saamm> *whistle*
[14:40:38] <Chiitoo> Hehe.

[15:16:03] <Saamm> zetok: I'm trying to see the changes done in my personnal repo. I'm following this: https://pages.github.com/  (GitHub for Windows chosen), but between the step 4 and step 5, nothing happens after I'm cliking on "Sync". By "nothing happens", I mean no webpage appears in http://saaaam.github.io/ (as it would "normally" do). Do you know what I'm doing wrong?
[15:44:32] <zetok> Saamm: there's no branch/repo that could be displayed there
[15:45:49] <zetok> Saamm: i.e. you need to use `gh-pages` branch
[15:45:58] <Saamm> I see
[15:47:09] <Saamm> I tried the "Automatic Generator". It's not doing it...
[15:47:27] <zetok> ?
[15:50:14] <Saamm> Seriously, all I want is to put the index.mustache as the index of saaam.github.io. It's so easy doing it with a simple FTP transfert usually... >.<
[15:51:40] <zetok> `git branch gh-pages menu-top-add && git push origin gh-pages`
[15:51:51] <zetok> dunno how to do that on windows
[15:51:56] <Saamm> I don't know too
[15:52:13] <Saamm> I didn't use any code for now
[15:52:24] <zetok> btw, flags are missing
[15:52:37] <Saamm> I tried to join something called "bash git" to my github account - didn't work
[15:52:44] <Saamm> Right!
[15:52:54] <Saamm> I'm adding them
[16:01:31] <Saamm> Done. There are more flags than currently used - it could be useful for the future...

[19:17:02] <zetok> yes
[19:17:22] *** Parts: reBrain (~reBrain@ ) ()
[19:17:26] <zetok> um, you need to build website
[19:18:02] <ovalseven8> irungentoo/toxcore is now more or less officially dead :P
[19:18:42] <Saamm> https://github.com/qTox/qTox-Website#building-the-site  <  with this ?
[19:19:56] <zetok> Saamm: ~yep
[19:20:11] <Saamm> Damn...
[19:20:31] <zetok> Saamm: most of that stuff can be done manually
[19:20:43] <zetok> it's just that it would take a lot of time
[19:24:00] <zetok> ovalseven8: hm?
[19:24:50] <zetok> Saamm: um, is using a VM with Linux an option for you?
[19:25:08] <ovalseven8> zetok, Seems like iphy and grayhatter are planning without irungentoo and grayhatter/toxcore is the new active repository (at least temporarily)
[19:25:20] <Saamm> To tell the truth, even if there are some explanations about building the site, this doesn't help the guy who doesn't know anything (=> me) to build it :/   I mean "Python 2 or 3 is required" < I though Python was just a language, not a "file", any "object" that is required;  "pystache library"  < okay, a little search on the internet and this probably could be easily downloadable. But, after that, what should we do with it? Where should
[19:25:30] <Saamm> There are a lot of questions :3
[19:25:58] <zetok> there are 2 major versions of python, 2 and 3
[19:26:00] <Saamm> Not really, I'm already fighting with the space of my computer ^^"
[19:26:09] <zetok> I see
[19:26:35] <Saamm> I do a lot of things (music recording & editing, videos, etc. etc.)
[19:27:00] <zetok> mm
[19:27:30] <Saamm> I constantly have to erase projects. Yeah, I should buy an extern hard disk :x
[19:27:42] <zetok> um, basically, it will be very hard for you to do stuff under windows, while on Linux it would be as simple as just typing a few commands
[19:27:56] <Saamm> I see
[19:29:03] <zetok> i.e. most of the stuff you've mentioned wouldn't bother one on Linux at all, given that python is installed by default, and pystache would be ~1 install command away
[19:29:13] <zetok> all of this nicely integrated to just work™
[19:30:08] <zetok> if you'd have like 10GB free you could just use Linux
[19:30:34] <zetok> and if you would want slimmer option, at the cost of making it harder, 5 GB
[19:30:37] <Saamm> I'm so used to have a certain comfort to create websites, webpages, just need a FTP launcher and that's it, file on the server & it's done, that it brings a certain frustration not to have it done quickly and as easy as usual for me :3
[19:31:05] <zetok> um, current setup kinda allows that
[19:31:33] <zetok> except that it's only for ready website, if you want stuff for testing, you'd need to set things for it locally

[23:01:08] <zetok> 2. some aren't visible
[23:01:22] <zetok> i.e. there's a "hidden" column
[23:01:23] <Saamm> Damn
[23:01:44] <Saamm> Which is the last country displayed?
[23:02:07] <zetok> depends on the browser I use
[23:02:47] <Saamm> I see...
[23:02:47] <zetok> zh_TW.html / tr.html
[23:03:01] <zetok> same goes for 1.
[23:03:34] <zetok> eh, this is why being able to build locally would be good
[23:03:48] <Saamm> You're right on that
[23:04:39] *** Quits: sudden6 (~anonymous@ ) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[23:21:14] <zetok> Saamm: as a work-around, you could copy index.mustache to `site/`, rename it to .html and work with that
[23:21:36] <Saamm> Good idea
[23:22:13] <Saamm> I'm gonna try this, as I just commited slighty changes to fix the 2 things we were talking about
[23:26:01] <zetok> err, there's a regression
[23:26:17] <zetok> flag
[23:27:01] <Saamm> Oo ?
[23:27:06] <zetok> <a href="eo.html"><img src="assets/imgs/flags/European_Union.png" alt="" class="flag"><span> Esperanto</span></a><br />
[23:27:18] <Saamm> Arf
[23:27:28] <Saamm> Right
[23:27:41] <zetok> git diff HEAD~2..HEAD
[23:27:45] <zetok> :)
[23:28:23] <zetok> https://a.uguu.se/pWVndZcDsSRS.png ← not a real problem, and looks ok with en version
[23:30:49] <Saamm> Regression fixed
[23:31:44] <zetok> err
[23:31:52] <zetok> that last one should be removed
[23:32:20] <Saamm> Yup, this is a problem that need to be fixed, we talked about that days ago. I know how to display the good flag with some PHP, but as there can't be any on qTox website... I don't know how to do it.
[23:32:25] <zetok> db44003 ← that kind of stuff is not going to float
[23:36:20] <Saamm> Oops
[23:36:38] <Saamm> My bad, I misread what you told me earlier... I fix this
[23:37:12] <zetok> um
[23:37:27] * zetok should have been more clear
[23:37:35] <Saamm> No no
[23:37:45] <Saamm> I should have read properly what you said  ;)
[23:37:54] <Saamm> The fault is on me
[23:41:25] <zetok> well, night :)
[23:42:35] <Saamm> Good night Zetok ;)
[23:42:50] <Saamm> And sorry not being quite efficient  ^^"
