[20:35:55] <Diadlo> zetok: I understand right, that no crash, if you open settings? (about video stream)
[20:36:26] <zetok> there's no crash if I set the device again
[20:38:01] <Diadlo> But JUST opening av settings tab doesn't change anything?
[20:40:33] <Diadlo> zetok:  And what about changing mode, but not device? It fix crash?
[20:40:59] <zetok> >But JUST opening av settings tab doesn't change anything?
[20:41:03] <zetok> dunno actually
[20:41:10] <Diadlo> Can you try?
[20:41:37] <zetok> yep
[20:44:23] <zetok> crashes
[20:45:07] <Diadlo> And the last one :)
[20:45:07] <zetok> ~interesting, there was `None` video device show in settings
[20:45:21] <Diadlo> Hm..
[20:45:23] <zetok> and yet
[20:45:24] <zetok> Debug: SIZER QRect(0,0 0x0)
[20:45:34] <Diadlo> Yes, it's normal
[20:45:51] <Diadlo> > And what about changing mode, but not device? It fix crash?
[20:46:11] <Diadlo> Oh, if you have "None" you can test it
[20:46:13] <Diadlo> Sorry :)

[21:38:37] <zetok> >Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
[21:39:31] <zetok> Diadlo: ↑
[21:40:16] <Diadlo> Fixed
[21:41:44] <zetok> thanks
[21:42:03] <Diadlo> No problem)
[21:44:31] <zetok> crashes without going into settings

[21:49:30] <Diadlo> Big thanks, seems, problem ~in CameraDevice::getDefaultDeviceName
[22:03:47] <Diadlo> zetok: Another one test, if you can
[22:03:52] <Diadlo> With new commit
[22:04:24] <Diadlo> 1) Make call without crash (open settings, change device, etc.)
[22:04:33] <Diadlo> 2) Make call with crash
[22:04:37] <Diadlo> And send both logs

[22:12:16] <zetok> Diadlo: ↑
[22:13:44] <Diadlo> Hm... It's really strange
[22:14:02] <Diadlo> Can you change any checkbox in your settings and check it after restart?
[22:14:35] <zetok> yep
[22:14:58] <Diadlo> It changed?
[22:17:47] <Diadlo> zetok: ↑
[22:19:57] <zetok> sorry for the wait, I needed to copy right files from backup to restore stuff that made qTox crash
[22:20:18] <Diadlo> np
[22:20:43] <Diadlo> qTox crash broke your files?
[22:20:48] <zetok> nah
[22:21:01] <zetok> saved config crashes qTox when starting video
[22:21:12] <zetok> ;D
[22:21:19] <zetok> still crashes
[22:21:58] <Diadlo> > Can you change any checkbox in your settings and check it after restart?
[22:22:08] <zetok> yep, that's what I did
[22:22:34] <Diadlo> But I don't need video test :)
[22:22:47] <zetok> um?
[22:23:27] <Diadlo> When you change status of any checkbox and after restart them state saved?
[22:23:51] <zetok> um?
[22:23:52] <zetok> yes?
[22:24:16] <Diadlo> Why it's question?)
[22:24:35] <zetok> I'm not sure if I understood – if you're asking whether config is saved after restart and loaded correctly, then yes
[22:24:37] <Diadlo> Sorry for my bad english
[22:24:49] <Diadlo> Yes
[22:25:27] <Diadlo> It's boolshit. I don't know
[22:26:30] <zetok> Diadlo: https://gist.github.com/zetok/48170d57d9fa5c4cd89693175ccfe509 ← perhaps try with this in `qtox.ini` ?
[22:26:58] <Diadlo> Stop
[22:27:13] <Diadlo> You always use same config?
[22:27:25] <Diadlo> > videoDev=x11grab#:0
[22:27:27] <zetok> for this, yes
[22:27:32] <Diadlo> This line is wrong
[22:27:35] <zetok> 'no'
[22:27:38] <Diadlo> videoDev=x11grab#:0.0
[22:27:47] <Diadlo> Try with this
[22:27:52] <zetok> it's the line that earlier qTox version set, and it's perfectly valid
[22:28:10] <zetok> the problem is that newest qTox crashes with old settings
[22:28:15] <Diadlo> Yes
[22:28:25] <Diadlo> Oh my god
[22:28:53] <Diadlo> All this time, I think, that problem with new settings
[22:29:46] <zetok> sorry
[22:29:51] <zetok> I should have made it more clear
[22:30:15] <Diadlo> But user can once change device and it should fix problem. It's not normal?
[22:30:21] <zetok> no
[22:30:28] <zetok> user shouldn't be expected to do that
[22:30:52] <zetok> if qTox crashes due to settings it set by itself in earlier version, that's a qTox problem
[22:31:25] <Diadlo> Ok. It will be easy to fix. Thanks :)
[22:31:27] <zetok> and it's kinda needed anyway for qTox to be able to handle malformed/invalid settings
[22:32:00] <Diadlo> I agree with you

[23:41:27] <zetok> yep
[23:42:06] <Emcy> are qtox nightlies still a thing
[23:42:40] <Emcy> i tried to get the "nightly" build from jenkins, and it was v 1.4.0 and demanded to upgrade itself right away
[23:43:04] <zetok> Emcy: use the right repo
[23:43:25] <Emcy> i dont use repos
[23:43:31] <Emcy> i sue windows binaries
[23:43:36] <zetok> ok
[23:44:06] <zetok> right, builds for windows are broken due to migration
[23:44:27] <zetok> =.="
[23:44:36] <zetok> or was it fixed?
[23:44:43] * zetok doesn't remember
[23:44:43] <Emcy> oh
[23:45:31] <zetok> ><nurupo> fixed windows builds (the NSIS plugin issue)
[23:45:35] <zetok> ah, it was fixed
[23:45:58] <zetok> Emcy: so, theoretically, there should(?) be nightly builds for windows
[23:46:53] <zetok> Emcy: only .zip though, and they might prompt you for update
[23:46:57] <Emcy> i tried it and it was 1.4.0
[23:47:04] <zetok> (which will results in a downgrade)
[23:47:17] <Emcy> unless the version number is irrelevatn
[23:47:26] <zetok> also, the thing you would want to look at is the commit hash
[23:47:33] <zetok> it may, or may not be
[23:47:45] <Emcy> ok
[23:48:09] <zetok> Diadlo: still crashes
[23:48:38] <Emcy> what exactly triggers jenkins to rebuild packages
[23:48:53] <Emcy> it rebuilt everything related to qtox 23hrs ago
[23:48:56] <zetok> if nothing changed, push to master
[23:49:00] <Emcy> but "no changes"
[23:49:04] * zetok shrugs
