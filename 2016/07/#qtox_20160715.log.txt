[16:19:10] <Emcy> i think there might be a problem with the way qtox maintains presence on local network segments
[16:19:44] <Emcy> as in it seems to forget to do so after a number of hours
[16:19:59] <Emcy> or maybe its toxcore idk
[16:21:10] <zetok> toxcore
[16:25:13] *** Joins: cisc (~cisc@ )
[16:25:54] <Emcy> the broadcast domain stuff is in toxcore?
[16:26:41] <zetok> yep
[16:26:51] <zetok> qTox doesn't do networking
[16:27:21] <zetok> it just calls to toxcore, and toxcore does whatever it needs to do
[16:27:54] <zetok> the only part where qTox itself touches the network is toxme
[16:28:14] <Emcy> ok

[17:28:45] * zetok wonders where's Saamm when needed
[17:29:01] <zetok> or anyone who can into CSS, for that matter
[17:29:40] *** Quits: cisc (~cisc@ ) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[17:31:24] <Chiitoo> zetok: What's that about CSS?  (Not sure I can be of any helh, though.)
[17:31:28] <Chiitoo> s/helh/help/
[17:33:29] <zetok> https://a.uguu.se/N25oWJYnyHCz.png
[17:33:55] <zetok> almost there, this happens only with some languages, and only if browser window is sufficiently small
[17:35:07] <zetok> https://github.com/zetok/qTox-Website/blob/langs-link/assets/css/language-menu-top.css ← that's with one line removed
[17:35:56] <zetok> without the line removed it flag was located above language name
[17:36:12] *** Joins: cisc (~cisc@ )
[17:36:13] <zetok> so I'm wondering if it's possible to make it somehow not "break" ..
[17:36:15] <zetok> !
[17:36:31] <zetok> do html engines respect unbreakable space?
[17:40:04] <zetok> eh, they don't
[17:40:37] <zetok> or is that kind of "breakage" acceptable on a website?

[18:17:09] <Chiitoo> zetok: Ah, the flag part jumps off of the language button?
[18:17:21] <zetok> ~yep
[18:18:09] <Chiitoo> I'll see if/ask if a friend can look at it.  Right now trying to get a delayed obs-studio version bump done!
[18:20:42] <zetok> thanks! :)
[18:22:59] <Chiitoo> I don't know much at all, but the friend has made a site or few, so maybe...
[18:25:55] <Chiitoo> Is there a way to load the site at that state?  I have never looked into github website things like that yet.  :S
[18:44:09] <zetok> not really
[18:44:21] <zetok> (also, it's not a gh thing)
[18:44:33] <zetok> I mean, you'd need to build it
[18:44:43] <zetok> (buildsite.sh)
[18:46:37] <zetok> https://github.com/zetok/sterminator ← needed to build
[18:48:46] <Chiitoo> Yeah, thought so.
[18:49:10] <Chiitoo> Friend can't say from just looking at the picture and code either.  Would need to be able to actually test it.
[18:50:19] <Emcy> qtox allows multiple instances of itself
[18:52:31] <zetok> Chiitoo: as a work-around, one could just manually substitute values
[18:52:57] <Chiitoo> True.
[18:53:35] <Chiitoo> I'm hoping someone else will be able to help with that soon though!
[18:54:28] <Chiitoo> Before anything new, I should be focusing on the things I have on my plate(s) already.  >.<
