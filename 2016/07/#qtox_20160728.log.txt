[20:35:53] <zetok> aside from that, https://github.com/tux3/qTox/pull/3528 ?
[20:35:59] <sudden6> yep, is ok
[20:37:00] <sudden6> codewise 3528 is ok, does it fix what it's supposed to and don't break anything?
[20:37:03] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] zetok closed pull request #3543: docs(CONTRIBUTING.md): make more explicit what commit message needs (master...contrib) https://git.io/vKS3v
[20:37:44] <zetok> sudden6: fixes, and doesn't seem to break, although I haven't tested it a lot
[20:38:18] <zetok> sudden6: I've looked a bit into automating testing GUI, and that requires support for accessibility
[20:38:36] <sudden6> hmm, there's a whitespace issue in the pr...
[20:38:46] <zetok> thing is, I have been able to only get accessibility work with gtk3 stuff, and not qt5 :/
[20:39:45] <zetok> I'm kinda lost, and qt docs don't really say what needs to be done (code needs to be written?, compiling with a flag?) to make qt5 application accessible
[20:39:49] <zetok> :s
[20:40:29] <zetok> https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/accessible-qwidget.html ← perhaps that'll make sense for someone who can into C++
[20:40:47] <zetok> >To provide accessibility support for a widget or other user interface element, you need to implement the QAccessibleInterface and distribute it in a QAccessiblePlugin
[20:44:42] <zetok> Diadlo: https://github.com/tux3/qTox/pull/3551 ← does it work now?
[20:45:32] <zetok> >there's a whitespace issue in the pr...
[20:45:39] <Diadlo> For me, yes
[20:45:42] <zetok> sudden6: so it's perfect to merge ;)
[20:45:44] <sudden6> zetok: haven't read through everything yet, but this mostly states that for custom widgets/user interface elements you have to implement something
[20:46:06] <zetok> and qTox uses custom stuff a lot, right?
[20:46:22] <sudden6> yeah, for the chat interface...
[20:46:22] <Diadlo> > there's a whitespace issue in the pr
[20:46:26] <Diadlo> Where?
[20:46:46] <zetok> Diadlo: um, what editor are you using?
[20:47:01] <Diadlo> Qt creator
[20:47:07] <zetok> oh.

[20:47:36] <zetok> Diadlo: ↑ if you were to happen to use vim
[20:47:40] <sudden6> doesn't the green bar mean there are spaces where they don't belong?
[20:48:38] <sudden6> if you use qtcreator, switch code style to "Qt" and it will remove unnecessary whitespace on save :)
[20:50:59] <Diadlo> Qt style already in use
[20:52:23] <Diadlo> Fixed :)

[20:54:59] <sudden6> zetok: did you get any progress with the travis mac toxcore issue?
[20:55:10] <zetok> upstream issue

[21:33:12] <zetok> not in qTox
[21:33:29] <bashrc> can you do it from toxcore?

[21:36:33] <zetok> way easier to use Rust bindings though
[21:37:05] <zetok> or something; there are python bindings, so it's possible that they're easy to use too
[21:37:26] * zetok wonders
[21:38:37] <bashrc> ok
[21:39:15] <zetok> (just a few lines in Rust, and I suspect that it would be the same story using python bindings)
[21:40:01] <bashrc> c is probably good enough
[21:40:29] <bashrc> automating the profile creation should make the mesh UI as a simple as possible
[21:40:42] <zetok> "mesh UI" ?
[21:41:01] <bashrc> boot from USB -> enter username -> generate profile -> open qtox with the -q option
[21:41:33] <bashrc> I'm using tox on a mesh network
[21:43:01] <zetok> qTox's UI for profile creation is not good?
[21:44:00] <bashrc> what I'm trying to get to is a condition where there is minimum friction and where the initial profile generated doesn't have a password. That enables a background process to read the ID and broadcast it to other mesh users
[21:44:11] <bashrc> "foo has joined the mesh"
[21:45:27] <zetok> I see
[22:03:02] * zetok wonders
[22:03:47] <zetok> qTox needs more maintainers :s
[22:14:25] <sudden6> zetok: +1
[22:14:38] <sudden6> also more contributors^^
[22:14:57] <zetok> yeah, but contributors are constrained by maintainers
[22:15:11] <zetok> i.e. people don't see a point in contributing if stuff isn't being merged
[22:15:33] <zetok> and stuff not being merged for few days == stuff not being merged
[22:15:52] <zetok> (that's how it looks from the outside)

[22:18:33] <sudden6> I'm thinking about a "Tested" flag
[22:21:09] <zetok> mm
[22:21:19] <zetok> good idea
[22:22:46] <sudden6> whoever sets the "Tested" flag is responsible for, testing that a PR fixes the things it claims or provides the features it claims
[22:23:03] <sudden6> and also doesn't introduce any appearant bugs
[22:23:15] <sudden6> still good?
[22:23:27] <zetok> um
[22:23:35] <zetok> idea is good, as for implementation..
[22:24:25] <sudden6> tell me your concerns
[22:25:13] <oranges> https://file.house/dim2.jpg
[22:25:51] <zetok> burden for maintainers and disassociation of testing from users
[22:27:09] <sudden6> please explain in more detail
[22:28:27] <Diadlo> May be "Tested" can be divided on 3 "Tested-<OS>"
[22:28:32] <zetok> if "flag" is github label, only people with push access can change those, which leads to a situation where they have to do it themselves, while users "see" that things are limited to maintainers, and as such there's no need (or space) for them to contribute
[22:28:46] <Diadlo> *?
[22:29:18] <zetok> thus, users are pushed into situation where less testing is being required from them..
[22:29:44] <sudden6> Diadlo: I think for most of the PRs it's OS agnostic and where it's relevant it could be expressed in a comment
[22:30:14] <sudden6> zetok: I see your concern, but currently how many users have been testing PRs?
[22:30:24] <Diadlo> Yes, you are right, sorry
[22:30:50] <zetok> sudden6: a few, and making smaller is wrong
[22:31:17] <zetok> sudden6: also, what is currently is suboptimal, and also should be changed, so that users could test things easily
[22:31:45] <zetok> sudden6: IIRC you weren't here when there was discussion about making it easier for people to test stuff?
[22:31:46] <sudden6> Hmm, what are the alternatives then? One could only try to make better comments for PRs
[22:31:54] <sudden6> zetok: nope

[22:34:05] <cisc> I noticed when on an audio call (not sure about video) if a contact sends you a message concurrently to the call, it plays the ringtone sound, not the incoming message chime
[22:34:30] <zetok> sudden6: https://github.com/qTox/qtox-irc-logs/blob/master/2016/07/%23qtox_20160724.log.txt#L231 ← from there
[22:34:57] <zetok> sudden6: also, 'people testing stuff' < 'automated tests'
[22:36:59] <sudden6> zetok: thx, so seems like storage space is an issue?
[22:37:13] <zetok> also building
[22:38:10] <zetok> hmm
[22:38:23] <zetok> perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the whole thing is an issue
[22:38:48] <sudden6> seems like you want to do travis on your own?
[22:38:51] <zetok> which then raises the question whether we're not approaching the actual problem the wrong way
[22:39:54] <zetok> not really
[22:40:09] <zetok> I think that the priority should be different
[22:40:15] <zetok> 1. automate GUI testing
[22:40:29] <zetok> 2. make building qTox easy & reproducible
[22:40:45] <sudden6> have you taken a look at openQA?
[22:40:53] <zetok> yes, it's useless
[22:41:44] <sudden6> yep, but if a big company has problems doing GUI testing, how are we gonna do it significantly better with much less effort?
[22:41:56] <sudden6> (please ignore my demotivating tone)
[22:42:48] <sudden6> AFAIK automated GUI testing is HARD
[22:42:50] <zetok> :D
[22:42:57] <zetok> dunno about demotivating
[22:43:23] <sudden6> I don't put high hopes in #1
[22:43:41] <zetok> ~same question applies to the huge company though: could they be doing it wrong?
[22:43:45] <cisc> openQA actually catches a ton of bugs
[22:44:01] <cisc> that's why Tumbleweed doesn't come out broken every cycle
[22:44:24] <cisc> https://openqa.opensuse.org/tests/230100
[22:44:36] <zetok> cisc: yes, it's broken by default, so people don't notice other breakages
[22:45:50] <zetok> cisc: and openqa being useful for opensuse doesn't constitute it being useful for qTox
[22:45:55] <sudden6> is it even possible to get qTox into openQA?
[22:45:57] <cisc> true
[22:46:14] <sudden6> running on suse infrastructure?
[22:46:40] <zetok> nope, or at least it seems that way
[22:47:27] <sudden6> well then openQA seems to be out anyway
[22:48:48] <sudden6> zetok: you mentioned some testing using the qt accessibility stuff, how did you plan to do this?
[22:49:20] <zetok> dogtail
[22:50:59] <sudden6> looks promising atleast on the first read
[22:51:14] <sudden6> where to run it is still an open question tough
