[10:18:42] <zetok> if I understand correctly, most of the logging (date & place in source) is being logged by `qDebug()`, right?
[10:20:18] <zetok> [09:30:57.551] src/persistence/profile.cpp:308
[10:20:25] <zetok> ↑ that part, right?
[10:20:26] <Diadlo> Yes
[10:20:37] <Diadlo> It easy to change
[10:20:47] <Diadlo> I talk about format
[10:21:15] <zetok> `[09:30:57.551 UTC]`
[10:21:30] <Diadlo> Ok

[10:56:34] <bashrc> is it possible to re-load the bootstrap nodes periodically, or are they only read once on startup?
[10:57:08] <bashrc> (in a mesh the list of available bootstrap nodes can vary over time)
[10:58:15] <Diadlo> Not periodically. Settings -> General -> Reconnect
[10:58:24] <Diadlo> Only manual
[10:58:38] <Diadlo> // As I know
[10:59:22] <bashrc> could there be an automatic option in the ini file?
[11:01:15] <Diadlo> Now isn't available. If somebody more competent (zetok?) confirm it, you can create issue
[11:01:34] <Diadlo> zetok: ↑ ?

[11:02:42] <zetok> bashrc: yes and no
[11:03:13] <zetok> i.e. toxcore does keep nodes to bootstrap off by itself
[11:03:36] <zetok> as for bootstrap nodes provided by qTox, no, there's not going to be an option like that
[11:03:51] <zetok> if you want them updated, make a PR to qTox with an update
[11:03:57] <zetok> (there are tools to do it)
[11:04:13] <zetok> ><zetok> i.e. toxcore does keep nodes to bootstrap off by itself
[11:04:44] <zetok> i.e. peers from the network, and the list does get updated if you're connected to the network
[11:05:51] <zetok> as for option to manually reconnect periodically, again, not happening, since needing to restart is a bug, and this needs to be fixed, not hidden away
[11:05:56] <zetok> (bug in toxcore)
[11:06:37] <zetok> >are they only read once on startup?
[11:06:38] <zetok> yep
[11:07:06] <zetok> they're just needed to bootstrap into network for the first time, from there toxcore does rest of the job and updates stuff by itself
[11:07:22] <bashrc> I agree that needing to restart is a bug. Ideally peers with toxcore move in and out of the mesh, but an edge running qTox can still find the list of bootstrap nodes
[11:07:43] <zetok> note though that if all of the nodes that toxcore has 'cached' will become offline, the bootstrap list will be used to bootstrap into network
[11:07:59] *** Quits: abbat (~abbat@ ) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[11:09:17] <zetok> um
[11:09:37] <zetok> right, sorry, the wording I used was a bit misleading
[11:09:53] <zetok> there's no "list" per se – there are just other nodes that you're connected to
[11:10:13] *** Joins: abbat (~abbat@ )
[11:10:21] <zetok> and each of them (provided that they do have port forwarded) can be used to bootstrap into network
[11:10:42] <zetok> and that's the "list" that toxcore has
[11:10:53] <zetok> (in simplification)
[11:11:15] <bashrc> the list within the ini file can be periodically updated via avahi broadcasts. The question then is, can qtox read that list occasionally
[11:11:26] <zetok> need to forward port will be nullified once toxcore gets upnp (or whatever it's called)
[11:11:36] <zetok> no, and no
[11:12:00] <zetok> updating it like that would be a good example of "doing it wrong"
[11:12:27] <bashrc> what would doing it right look like?
[11:12:32] <zetok> make a PR
[11:12:35] <oranges> when are you gonna rejoin tox zetok 
[11:12:38] <oranges> it's inevitable
[11:12:51] <zetok> oranges: there's #toktok
[11:12:59] <zetok> and that's what's inevitable
[11:13:05] <oranges> toktok will join tox too
[11:13:19] <zetok> it's the other way around
[11:13:27] <oranges> you'll see
[11:13:34] <zetok> since "tox" can't get anything done
[11:13:43] <zetok> I'm already seeing
[11:13:52] <oranges> the future is so bright
[11:14:24] <zetok> you might want to move away from the incoming train

[14:50:42] <bashrc> it looks like Reconnect maybe resets toxcore. So to update the bootstrap list presumably it's toxcore which needs to be patched
[14:55:01] <zetok> …
[15:03:09] <bashrc> ok so looks patchable. Maybe every N seconds I check the known list of bootstrap nodes, compare it with the existing one and if it has changed then call bootstrap_from_config
