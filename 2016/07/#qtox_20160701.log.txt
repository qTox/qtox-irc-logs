[19:54:44] <toweI> is qtox faux offline messaging still working?
[19:58:35] <zetok> yes
[19:59:03] <toweI> zetok, why are there no circles anymore?
[19:59:12] <zetok> uh
[20:00:14] <zetok> 4f493c5df73dffef25e4f34984fdb736f8da626c works
[20:01:02] <zetok> i.e. has spinner
[20:01:57] <toweI> let me see. I am using latest release
[20:02:20] <zetok> and works on 9694d6b6d434bb7557c9766e89dce5fb4cb89502 (latest, just emerged)
[20:02:56] <toweI> I guess it got broken and fixed
[20:03:19] <zetok> hmm
[20:06:03] <zetok> what os, and which version doesn't work for you?
[20:08:02] <toweI> https://github.com/tux3/qTox/commit/8d225a8c97a36838092b325ca830c14546f3a0c6 windows. I am compiling latest commit now
[20:12:18] <toweI> no it's somehow broken
[20:12:29] <zetok> :/
[20:13:29] <toweI> it works on a clean settings.ini
[20:14:52] <toweI> I know what it is
[20:15:14] <toweI> offline messaging doesn't work anymore when history is disabled
[20:15:45] <toweI> or the circle is disabled 
[20:16:50] <zetok> oh, right
[20:17:11] <zetok> IIRC it's not supported with disabled history
[20:18:05] <zetok> toweI: https://github.com/tux3/qTox/issues/3022 ?
[20:19:43] <toweI> why is there so much dicussion^^ it's a simple issue
[20:20:29] <toweI> there are 2 options disable the faux offline message box or keep messages in memory 
[20:20:50] <toweI> * disable it when history is disabled
[20:21:02] <zetok> probably should be disabled
[20:21:37] <zetok> i.e. this probably will cause least amount of confusion
[20:22:11] <zetok> as opposed to messages that are supposed to be delivered, but magically disappear upon restart and aren't delivered
