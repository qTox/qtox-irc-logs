[00:31:30] <koshii> Why the passive aggression? :-)
[00:32:01] <koshii> I'm really blown away by the potential of qtox. You guys have a really good thing here, I hope you realize it. This needs a lot of love but it can really be something tremendously beneficial.
[00:34:21] *** Quits: f10 (~flo@ ) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:35:11] <zetok> right
[00:35:42] <koshii> Has there been *any* external funding up to this point?
[00:35:47] <zetok> koshii: what's your suggestion to pointing out to someone that they didn't manage to actually read stuff?
[00:35:48] <koshii> Any grants, donations, etc
[00:35:55] <zetok> not to the qTox
[00:36:21] <koshii> zetok: Haha, I don't know, but I always like to punctuate things with good humor. :)
[00:36:24] <zetok> there were a few donations with a few bucks to some people
[00:36:33] <koshii> Even if people are frustrating sometimes. The tables often turn.
[00:36:37] <koshii> That's it?
[00:36:45] <koshii> Gosh, there really should be an organized campaign.
[00:36:50] <zetok> um
[00:37:02] <zetok> the problem is that no one has the time to work for money
[00:37:06] <zetok> :|
[00:37:16] <koshii> I'm sure there are a lot of talented devs who would love to work on this full time, who could be hired as full-time tox devs
[00:37:24] <koshii> Oh I see
[00:37:26] <zetok> I've asked tux3, and he said that he wouldn't be able to find more time for qTox even if he was to be paid for work
[00:37:36] <koshii> Well then, job boards? :)
[00:37:45] <koshii> Like I said, I'm totally sure there's folks out there who would be into it.
[00:37:53] <zetok> possibly
[00:38:10] <koshii> I know some guys in Poland who could probably help with some things. I am thinking particularly with stuff like noise cancellation
[00:38:25] <zetok> hmm
[00:38:35] <koshii> Stuff that makes it more out-of-the-box usable 
[00:38:43] *** Joins: f10 (~flo@ )
[00:38:55] <koshii> Damn it's almost like qtox is "80%" ready to be thrown in front of non-technical users
[00:38:58] <koshii> Just a bit more push and it could be there.
[00:39:06] <zetok> thing is, for that kind of stuff person would need to have write access to the repo
[00:39:25] <koshii> I think they could do it independently and send a pull request
[00:39:27] <koshii> Why not?
[00:39:42] <zetok> dunno about tux3, but with my paranoia I wouldn't really want someone out of blue be given write access to qTox just so that they could cash out
[00:39:55] <zetok> well, their PRs would need to be merged
[00:40:05] <koshii> And reviewed :)
[00:40:09] <koshii> But isn't that what you guys want?
[00:40:14] <zetok> and out of 3 active maintainers who can review, they don't have much time
[00:40:15] <koshii> An active developer community
[00:40:26] <zetok> yeah
[00:40:33] <koshii> Well that's pretty unfortunate then, I must say.
[00:40:50] <zetok> mm
[00:41:00] <koshii> I don't know if it can get past that 80% easily without super engaged community participation
[00:41:33] <koshii> I guess a fork could be maintained, but that seems like working at cross-purposes
[00:41:45] <zetok> from what I see Diadlo has been rather active lately, so I guess they might want to become a maintainer
[00:42:26] <zetok> hmm
[00:42:28] <koshii> What's Diadlo? A company?
[00:42:37] <zetok> https://github.com/Diadlo
[00:42:53] <zetok> qTox contributor
[00:42:58] <koshii> Ah
[00:43:35] <koshii> So -- assuming the pull request/review process is figured out and time is found for that -- I think there could be a lot of benefit in also getting this into the official debian repo
[00:43:40] <koshii> The project will be seen by a lot more people there
[00:43:52] <zetok> >I think there could be a lot of benefit in also getting this into the official debian repo
[00:43:53] <koshii> Since that will also spill out into all the nice Debian-based distros 
[00:43:53] <zetok> no
[00:44:13] <koshii> Yeah I couldn't remember if it was you or not who was opposed to this the last time I brought it up
[00:44:25] <zetok> I mean, anyone is free to package, but that won't be supported. Period.
[00:44:33] <koshii> Just because of time?
[00:45:07] <zetok> no, it won't be supported since there's 0 reasons to support broken versions that debian desperately clings to
[00:45:26] <koshii> Yes, I guess it was you :)
[00:46:09] <zetok> if you want to look at something that is supported and "packaged" for distro, look at Gentoo
[00:46:14] <koshii> Well I'm sure there's a way around this, either through active backports or whatever.
[00:46:32] <koshii> Yes but the problem is that Gentoo isn't the basis of 95% of the most popular distros :)
[00:46:41] <koshii> As a vehicle for increasing the network effect, it is marginally helpful only.
[00:46:44] <zetok> that's problem of those distros
[00:47:40] <zetok> effectively, they aren't able to provide what their users desire, just because they haven't figured out that they can use Gentoo as a base
[00:48:09] <koshii> Well we can't solve every problem :)
[00:48:09] <zetok> check, even clinging to broken versions that debian needs can be done via Gentoo
[00:48:32] <zetok> mm
[00:48:37] <koshii> I'm just saying, what I want to see is an increase in tox's network of users
[00:48:55] <koshii> That seems like a way to do it, albeit perhaps it would be a massive pain in the arse.
[00:49:01] <zetok> question: how happy would users be getting from distro qTox version that won't work?
[00:49:10] <koshii> Yes, you're right.
[00:50:27] <koshii> But there *could* be a message in the app like: "qTox is an actively developed, ever-changing project. If this install does not work for you, please add the backports sources list to your reporitory [or the official one for qtox nightly]."
[00:50:37] <koshii> There may be changes, bla bla bla
[00:50:53] <zetok> that would be working around broken distro packaging
[00:51:00] <koshii> And of course even better would be to have an API/network support plan that corresponds to some of these more important releases, but I perhaps digress...
[00:51:09] <koshii> qTox "LTS", if you will :)
[00:51:31] <koshii> I know, I know... Time, where will it be found.
[00:51:50] <zetok> thing is, there are no resources to support that kind of thing
[00:52:11] <zetok> thus, there will be breakages, since that's the path of least amount of effort that brings most benefits
[00:52:45] <zetok> and again, even with "LTS" there will be broken distro packages
[00:53:17] <zetok> unless debian could make an exception, like they already do for ff
[00:53:35] *** Quits: abbat (~Anton@ ) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:55:21] <koshii> Well, has anyone asked? :-)
[00:56:38] <zetok> last time I've looked, they were hard bent on "not happening, ever, no exceptions!" in case of xscreensaver
[00:57:00] <koshii> Doesn't mean it can't happen :)
[00:57:07] <zetok> koshii: mind asking debian people?
[00:58:19] <koshii> zetok: I'll look into it. In fact we have a similar issue on the Ethereum side.

[21:13:45] <zetok> your point is invalid
[21:14:06] <linuxmodder> how so

[21:19:17] <linuxmodder> then what IS relevant  in 3343 about  vidcalls using  cpu

[21:19:45] <linuxmodder> no shit and OS plays a BIG part in that 
[21:19:54] <linuxmodder> almost as much as  toxcore

[21:21:14] <linuxmodder> because only  1  person can commit to it ?   cuz he is reportedly only one knowing it that well??   come on what is it
[21:21:43] <linuxmodder> so QoS == Cpu usage thru roof how now?
[21:22:14] <linuxmodder> last I checked load balancers were not needed to run *tox
[21:22:40] <linuxmodder> and even if so it hardly uses enough b/w to load a cpu on connection work
[21:22:42] <zetok> err, I thought that you have bad quality of video call in mind
[21:23:04] <zetok> as for CPU usage, it's mainly due to VPX
[21:23:36] <linuxmodder> even then  seems the floor for 'quality' is  like 5mb/s  U/D have you not looked at a network spped map of the world lately ?
[21:25:06] <linuxmodder> and tbh one end having a less than optimal connection should NEVER cause that much issue with quality bi-laterally

[22:59:48] <bennypr0fane_> hello, I'm running SolydX, a Debian Jessie based distro. apt can't seem to find the qtox package in your repo. the line in sources.list.d/tox.list looks like this: deb https://pkg.tox.chat/debian nightly solydxk
[23:02:00] <bennypr0fane_> apt-get update outputs this: http://pastie.org/private/jw4rpx4bjlnuge6lnekbwg
[23:03:24] <zetok> use the right repo
[23:04:56] <bennypr0fane_> zetok, and which one is that?
[23:06:16] <bennypr0fane_> I followed these instructions: https://tox.chat/download.html#gnulinux
[23:07:03] <bennypr0fane_> i.e. I ran these lines, as posted there: http://pastie.org/private/t9qcqve0xq5zoqga8drx8a
[23:13:46] <zetok> bennypr0fane_: https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Aantonbatenev%3Atox&package=qtox
[23:15:36] <bennypr0fane_> zetok, aahh, always nice when official documentation is wrong. thanks for the help.
[23:16:03] <zetok> nope
[23:16:15] <zetok> bennypr0fane_: *official* documentation is correct
[23:16:55] <bennypr0fane_> well, the one from qtox is, the one from Tox isn't
[23:17:51] <zetok> dunno, perhaps tox.chat people are keeping like that deliberately

[23:24:48] <bennypr0fane_> zetok, why would they?
[23:25:21] <zetok> from what I've been told, they're acting rather hostile
[23:26:11] <zetok> so while before I wouldn't think that they might be not updating info deliberately, now I'm not so sure
[23:26:17] <bennypr0fane_> oh my
[23:26:20] <zetok> i.e. it has been this way for quite a long time
[23:26:56] <zetok> and I think that possibility that they don't have anyone working on the website can be excluded, since it got a nice new page lately
[23:26:58] <bennypr0fane_> hostile to people who implement their protocol in cross-platofrm software? yeah, that makes sense... :-P
[23:27:07] <zetok> yeah.
[23:28:38] <zetok> you're new to tox ecosystem, aren't you ;D
[23:28:43] <bennypr0fane_> yup
[23:29:07] <bennypr0fane_> i.e. I've tried to try it before, but couldn't get anyone to try it with me
[23:29:22] <bennypr0fane_> hung up on multi-device problem for now, it seems?
[23:30:16] <zetok> a year
[23:30:37] <bennypr0fane_> a year what?
[23:30:39] <zetok> that might be a probable amount of time after which there'll be working multidevice
[23:30:52] <bennypr0fane_> I see
[23:31:21] <zetok> assuming the current tempo
[23:31:24] <bennypr0fane_> what's your estimate based on? do you have any knowledge of the development going on?
[23:32:03] <zetok> https://github.com/tux3/qTox/pull/3353 :P
[23:32:48] <zetok> let's say that I might have a bit of insight.
[23:34:10] <nurupo> is tux3 busy?
[23:34:29] <nurupo> haven't seen him this weekend
[23:34:54] <zetok> probably
[23:39:09] <bennypr0fane_> thanks
