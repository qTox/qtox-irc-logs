[18:55:35] <anon_3367> hi
[18:56:00] <zetok> hello anon_3367 :)
[18:56:20] <anon_3367> can I poke your mind a little bit? regarding qTox?
[18:57:02] <zetok> go ahead
[18:57:06] <anon_3367> first let me thank you for you support on developing this great tool :)
[18:58:11] <zetok> you're welcome :)
[18:58:15] *** Quits: Chiitoo (~Chiitoo@ ) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[18:58:19] <anon_3367> here's the thing, I'm using qTox both on Windows 10 and OS X El Capitan, both are using Tor Browser as proxies 
[18:58:52] <anon_3367> it works well, but with the OS X version, I keep getting these little disconnects, every 2min mostly
[18:59:13] <anon_3367> me first guess - it's the Tor network, not the client right?
[18:59:21] <zetok> probably
[18:59:30] <zetok> or osx
[19:00:10] *** Joins: Chiitoo (~Chiitoo@ )
[19:00:40] <anon_3367> I'm trying to reproduce it on another OS X machine, if I get a positive result, can I post it as an issue on github?
[19:00:59] <anon_3367> (if it's qTox related obvioulsy)
[19:03:44] <zetok> if it's reproducible without tor, or with other socks proxy that doesn't introduce that kind of latency, it would be a toxcore issue
[19:04:03] <zetok> that is, osx issue which toxcore would need to work around
[19:04:21] <anon_3367> got it! thanks a lot for you time and patience!

[19:12:43] <Chiitoo> There's no issue open for “chat window shows 'new message' notification even while it's the active window”, is there?
[19:13:09] <zetok> not sure, there might have been such issue
[19:15:04] <Chiitoo> Hmmmhm.
[19:16:27] <zetok> can't find anything
[19:17:32] <zetok> Chiitoo: actually, that's a desired behaviour
[19:17:43] <Chiitoo> How so?
[19:18:45] <zetok> https://github.com/tux3/qTox/issues/1747
[19:19:09] <zetok> (1st post)
[19:20:18] <Chiitoo> Hmmm not sure it makes sense in this context.  I'm saying qTox is notifying about new messages even though the messages that are being received are coming to the chat that is the current active window.
[19:20:30] <Chiitoo> I have to actually change away from qTox and back to the same chat to clear it.
[19:20:39] <zetok> ok, this is not a desired behaviour
[19:20:44] <Chiitoo> Yeah.
[19:21:10] <Chiitoo> It's not a different contact I'm speaking of (and this is likely only happening for separate windows mode.
[19:21:13] <Chiitoo> )
[19:21:55] <Chiitoo> I /think/ it happened before the fix to the blinking never getting cleared without activating the main window, but I'm not sure any longer.
[19:39:57] <zetok> Chiitoo: mind opening an issue?
[19:40:34] <Chiitoo> I will if/when I remember to.
[19:56:39] *** Joins: piwirj (68eea912@ )
[20:02:10] <piwirj> Is it possible to copy a url into clipboard from qtox? For example, someone sends me the url https://tox.chat/ , and I want to copy the link into clipboard instead of immediately opening it in my defeault browser.
[20:02:46] <piwirj> e.g. in Firefox, I would right-click the link, and select Copy Link Location.
[20:11:39] *** Joins: abbat (~Anton@ )
[20:13:39] <zetok> piwirj: you can select link and copy it
[20:14:05] <zetok> not really the best way, but works for now

[20:16:50] <piwirj> though I accidentally press the url sometimes while doing that :(

[20:17:48] <zetok> um, sec, I'll see if there's an issue already for it
[20:17:59] <piwirj> zetok: I don't want to create a github account. I can live with the workaround.

[20:24:08] <piwirj> yes, there are lots of tiny details that would help bring qtox up to par with skype et al
