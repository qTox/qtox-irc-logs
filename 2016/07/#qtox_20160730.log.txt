[18:31:40] <sudden6> zetok: o/
[18:48:21] <zetok> sudden6: \o
[18:49:17] <sudden6> these meetings aren't quite as regular as we planned...
[18:52:33] <zetok> you mean, they're not happening at all
[18:52:55] <sudden6> yeah
[18:53:18] <zetok> mm
[18:53:29] <zetok> time to remove stuff form readme.md
[18:53:54] <sudden6> I think it would be bad to remove everything
[18:54:22] <sudden6> because having a plannend time where and when to meet is good
[18:54:47] <sudden6> the whole comitee thing is useless now tough
[18:55:21] <sudden6> *though
[18:55:48] <zetok> yep
[18:56:32] <zetok> so, committee thing is kil, tux3 also seems to be kil
[18:56:46] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] BiTOk opened pull request #3566: Fixed desktop sharing without camera connected (master...fix3476) https://git.io/vKjDI
[18:57:27] <sudden6> nah, tux3 is not kil
[18:57:45] <sudden6> I think he's pretty reachable by mail
[18:57:49] <zetok> nope
[19:00:33] <zetok> anyway
[19:00:48] <zetok> what do you think about the TokTok workflow?
[19:01:33] <sudden6> what workflow do you mean?
[19:02:13] <zetok> checks required to pass in order for PR to be merged, and one of checks is review done by someone other than PR submitter
[19:03:15] <sudden6> build checks a being a requirement is good
[19:03:27] <zetok> not according to tux3
[19:03:39] <sudden6> the review stuff is good for toxcore/hstox
[19:03:54] <sudden6> I know
[19:04:37] <sudden6> on the other side, if the checks itsefl break, see osx travis issue, there are problems
[19:04:57] <sudden6> with out active people who can deactivate the check
[19:05:07] <sudden6> *without
[19:05:37] <zetok> err
[19:06:33] <zetok> sorry, but what you wrote is invalid
[19:06:45] <zetok> >with out active people who can deactivate the check
[19:06:50] <zetok> that doesn't happen
[19:07:03] <sudden6> ?
[19:07:29] <zetok> you don't have multiple people and none of them being available to disable something
[19:07:43] <zetok> unless you do, then project is dead and it's time to move on
[19:08:12] <zetok> that's hardly relevant, since this doesn't apply to current setup
[19:08:25] <zetok> in current setup, there's only 1 person who can do stuff, namely tux3
[19:09:19] <sudden6> yeah, and that's the reason we don't have automatic build checks required^^
[19:09:29] <zetok> since tux3 is kill, and no one else can do stuff, I was wondering whether it's time to move on, whether people see point it it (already, or whether they feel like waiting more), and how to do that swiftly
[19:10:26] <sudden6> I get your point, it feels wrong to discuss this without the major involved people
[19:10:42] <zetok> ok :)
[19:10:53] <sudden6> major involved people = Diadlo, zetok, antis81, sudden6
[19:11:01] <sudden6> tux3
[19:11:12] <zetok> the proper way to go about it, is to open issue on gh, where everyone interested would be notified & be able to comment
[19:11:26] <sudden6> yeah, or an email
[19:11:31] <sudden6> or both
[19:11:34] <zetok> nah, email isn't really good
[19:11:49] <zetok> since it's not visible to people outside
[19:12:02] <zetok> and you do want clarity when doing stuff
[19:12:05] <sudden6> email pointing to gh issue? tux3 seems to ignore gh
[19:12:42] <zetok> if he does ignore gh, what point is there to forcing him to get on with things?
[19:13:23] <zetok> anyway, perhaps I'll see point in sending mails to him as soon as he starts reacting to them
[19:14:34] <sudden6> It still wouldn't be bad to send an email additionally, if he ignores both, well, kill it is
[19:15:18] <sudden6> I'd rather have changes gracefully
[19:20:28] <zetok> yeah.
[19:21:52] <sudden6> Moving to an org would solve this problem, right?
[19:22:30] <zetok> yes
[19:22:49] <zetok> to a degree, since github ors are shitty
[19:22:53] <zetok> orgs*
[19:22:59] <sudden6> to what degree?
[19:23:32] <zetok> "can be worked with, until gitlab gets into proper shape"
[19:24:13] <zetok> btw, the whole thing makes me realize how heavily stuff depends on github
[19:24:35] <sudden6> mhm
[19:25:33] <sudden6> pretty much everything goes over gh
[19:26:00] <sudden6> only separate stuff is tox.chat repo + mailing list and IRC
[19:26:24] <zetok> err, no, tox.chat stuff is irrelevant
[19:26:39] <sudden6> no
[19:26:44] <sudden6> it's there and works
[19:26:49] <zetok> ok, you're right, they make qTox look bad
[19:26:57] <sudden6> ...
[19:28:04] <sudden6> I still count them as people who care about Tox in general and little bit about qTox
[19:28:40] <zetok> yes, people have an inherent tendency to be overly optimistic, even to a degree where it hurts them
[19:29:43] <sudden6> I definitely agree with me beeing overly optimistic, but it's only there to compensate your pessimism ;)
[19:30:40] <zetok> hmm.
[19:31:07] <zetok> pessimist sees a dark tunnel
[19:31:15] <zetok> optimist sees a light in the tunnel
[19:31:24] <zetok> realist sees an incoming train
[19:32:08] <sudden6> pessimist sees a half empty glass
[19:32:16] * zetok prefers to be in a position of a train conductor, who sees three idiots standing on tracks
[19:32:16] <sudden6> optimist sees a half full glass
[19:32:30] <sudden6> engineer sees a glass twice as big as it needs to be
[19:33:24] * sudden6 prefers to read https://what-if.xkcd.com/6/
[19:34:50] <zetok> >I still count them as people who care about Tox in general and little bit about qTox
[19:35:21] <zetok> caring doesn't really constitute much, aside from wishful thinking
[19:35:55] <zetok> also, while positive things exists, they say nothing about the negative impact, which is way more important
[19:37:24] <zetok> (and it's not being "pessimistic", but it's a fact that people pay multiple times more attention to bad stuff)
[19:37:58] <sudden6> mhm
[19:38:37] <sudden6> currently from my POV positive things are the majority
[19:38:39] <zetok> so if your ratio good:bad is e.g. 5:1, you're already screwed, that's how bad it is, and tox.chat people don't even get 2:1 ratio
[19:39:36] <sudden6> err, I think that's wrong
[19:39:42] <zetok> nope
[19:39:51] <zetok> there is a research on that
[19:40:31] <zetok> (not about the tox.chat ratio, this being just my generous estimation, but about ratio in general)
[19:40:51] <zetok> >I think that's wrong
[19:40:55] <sudden6> if people "feel" negative things much stronger, and the felt ratio is 5:1 then reallity is 5:0.5
[19:41:00] <zetok> well, guess why we can't have nice things.
[19:41:20] <zetok> err
[19:41:38] <sudden6> and since you are also only a human your assumption aren't reallity :)
[19:41:39] <zetok> why are you putting "feels" into equation?
[19:41:58] <sudden6> it's just the word to describe subjective stuff here
[19:42:12] <sudden6> therefore the "
[19:42:47] <zetok> err
[19:43:03] <zetok> ><sudden6> if people "feel" negative things much stronger, and the felt ratio is 5:1 then reallity is 5:0.5
[19:43:05] <zetok> eh.
[19:43:16] <zetok> I guess I'll go do something else.
