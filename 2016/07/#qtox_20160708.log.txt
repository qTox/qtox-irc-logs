[18:53:03] <zenjie> Is it possible to cancel sending a faux offline message?
[18:53:37] <zenjie> I only see an option to clear displayed messages, but that only clears the display of the messages - it will send the faux offline messages once the contact is online
[18:59:40] <zetok> maybe
[19:00:04] <zetok> alternatively, you could turn qTox off, and manually edit db
[19:00:39] <zetok> (aka qTox doesn't have interface for it yet)

[19:33:21] <zetok> not much right now :)
[19:34:33] <user69> Thanks for replying :)
[19:37:24] <user69> Another qTox user brought up an article he found, and I was wondering if any of it pertained to "qTox"? https://blog.tox.im/2016/04/01/litigation/  
[19:37:44] <zetok> hm?
[19:38:12] <user69> Also wondering are any of the tox developers ex-NSA people or some from other security agency, that would afect the privacy of the TOX communications?
[19:38:32] <zetok> that's an interesting definition of an "article"
[19:39:01] <user69> It may be total fabrication, I do not know, thus my questions.
[19:39:10] <zetok> right
[19:39:47] <zetok> have you heard of the stqism serpent?
[19:40:01] <user69> No, what's that?

[21:19:51] <zetok> an idea
[21:20:04] <ovalseven8> Can you explain, please
[21:20:27] <zetok> you're not going to get $stuff from toxcore that it shouldn't handle
[21:20:52] <zetok> on the other hand, there is stuff that all clients should handle in uniform way
[21:21:04] <zetok> but it doesn't fall under what toxcore should do
[21:21:53] <ovalseven8> OK ...
[21:22:32] <zetok> how much are you interested in making stuff happen?
[21:23:03] <ovalseven8> zetok, I lack skills
[21:23:11] <zetok> you can always learn :)
[21:23:38] <ovalseven8> Have you worked on it?
[21:23:53] <zetok> no, since I don't perceive it as most important
[21:26:21] * zetok wonders
[21:27:01] <zetok> ovalseven8: depending on what you want, you might want to help with HLAPI, and/or libtoxclient, depending on what HLAPI will cover
[21:27:33] <ovalseven8> HLAPI, what exactly?
[21:28:15] <zetok> note that HLAPI is to be build on proper toxcore interface, and that's what should be done first
[21:29:03] <ovalseven8> Who is working on HLAPI/libtoxclient?
[21:29:16] <zetok> https://toktok.github.io/roadmap.html
[21:29:26] <zetok> libtoxclient – no one, just my idea
[21:30:44] <zetok> in any case, you'd want to learn Rust

[21:32:30] <ovalseven8> How's zetox going?
[21:33:03] <zetok> great :)

[21:33:53] <ovalseven8> <zetok> https://toktok.github.io/roadmap.html
[21:34:58] <ovalseven8> Current Tox situation is poor. irungentoo is dead/lost interest; grayhatter is working on his repository; iphy on his new repository
[21:35:06] <ovalseven8> That's not how it should be.
[21:35:41] <ovalseven8> And some are still waiting for irungentoo :X
[21:36:26] <zetok> that's their problem
[21:36:48] <ovalseven8> They don't want to see the problems. Or they just ignore it.
[21:37:35] * zetok too likes to state obvious stuff about human nature :3
[21:39:59] <ovalseven8> zetok, How many toxcore features are already in zetox?

[21:46:44] <cisc> qtox is constantly taking about 1% CPU utilization when idling, has anyone else noticed that?
[21:46:46] <ovalseven8> zetok, I see. So, the whole project depends more or less on irungentoo :(
[21:46:58] <zetok> what.
[21:47:07] <zetok> cisc: toxcore
[21:47:18] <cisc> zetok: yeah I figured, but do you think that's fixable
[21:47:28] <zetok> not in current toxcore
[21:47:51] <cisc> ;-\
[21:48:03] <zetok> perhaps with zetox
[21:49:29] <cisc> iphy & grayhatter should probably working together, so we don't end up with 20 different forks
[21:50:37] <zetok> pls.
[21:51:32] <zetok> https://a.uguu.se/nkgiQ2qhAlRZ.png
[21:52:39] <zetok> I mean, good thinking, but they've been doing that
[21:53:16] <cisc> well not that I'd seen
[21:53:19] <ovalseven8> I agree with cisc. There should be one official toxcore repository.
[21:54:01] <zetok> ><cisc> well not that I'd seen
[21:54:13] * zetok wonders
[21:54:36] * zetok shrugs
[21:55:02] <cisc> is that from #tox-dev ?
[21:55:11] <cisc> Last I saw grayhatter left #tox-dev
[21:55:18] <zetok> ha.

[21:57:55] <cisc> and you can have your second best buddy, linux-modder be your community liaison
[21:57:59] <zetok> I'm afraid that grayhatter wouldn't be able to handle that
[21:59:40] <zetok> anecdote: grayhatter asked me to provide toxcore log, so I've said that I don't know of any services that would allow upload of 25GB of log file, and I've asked where to upload it – to this day I still got no response :c
[22:00:16] <cisc> mega.nz
[22:00:47] <zetok> doesn't it require some proprietary stuff?
[22:01:17] <cisc> well for DL larger files it requires a browser plugin but it's open source

[22:07:55] <zetok> TES already works
[22:08:23] <zetok> aside from that, a bit far away
[22:09:44] <zetok> I could rush things and do them quickly, without tests, just to get something "working", but there would be little to no point to toxcore re-implementation then
[22:10:03] <cisc> so how many months would be your estimate?
[22:10:23] <zetok> working alone at current rate – years
[22:10:56] <zetok> since I don't do things quickly
[22:11:36] <cisc> well there had been talk about moving to a rust toxcore in #tox-dev, so if that decision was made then you wouldn't be the only one
[22:12:15] <cisc> iphy is busy working on toxcore tests, but..
[22:12:46] <cisc> there's nobody to further toxcore in C that truly knows how to further it from what I can tell
