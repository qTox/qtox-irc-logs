[15:26:04] <sudden6> zetok: ping
[15:26:10] <zetok> sudden6: pong
[15:26:51] <sudden6> should I push my rebase of the toktok switch onto Diadl0's branch or create a new PR?
[15:27:18] <zetok> sudden6: you probably should ask Diadl0
[15:28:00] <zetok> hmm
[15:28:36] <zetok> perhaps some guidelines are needed for that
[15:28:40] <sudden6> I'm trying to reach him on qTox, if he doesn't respond I'll create a new PR
[15:29:23] <sudden6> ><zetok> perhaps some guidelines are needed for that
[15:29:55] <sudden6> I don't think so, if someone makes the PR branch accessible to maintainers he basically agreed to that IMO
[15:30:12] <zetok> err
[15:30:23] <zetok> [04:45:36] <zero-one> iphy: i'm confused, how did you commit to my branch?
[15:30:23] <zetok> [04:49:12] <zetok> new gh feature
[15:30:23] <zetok> [04:51:08] <zero-one> can you elaborate?
[15:30:23] <zetok> [04:52:02] <zetok> checkbox on the right allows maintainers to push stuff to PR branches
[15:30:23] <zetok> [04:54:48] <zero-one> i c
[15:30:42] <sudden6> that feature isn't all that new lol
[15:31:04] <zetok> the point is that people don't necessarily know about it
[15:31:48] <sudden6> mhm, I'm just worried that qTox will get so much guidelines that nobody has time to do work or can even remember them
[15:32:02] <sudden6> it's not easy to find the right balance for that
[15:34:58] <sudden6> Diadl0 didn't answer, I'll create a new PR
[15:35:31] <zetok> :|
[15:35:34] <zetok> sudden6: I'd wait more
[15:36:26] <sudden6> define "more"
[15:36:45] <zetok> a few h?
[15:37:03] <sudden6> don't have that much time
[15:37:22] <zetok> ok
[15:37:43] <sudden6> I'll create a new PR and Diadl0 can merge/rebase this back into the old one when he has time

[15:41:49] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] sudden6 opened pull request #3961: Toktok migration (master...toktokMigration) https://git.io/v1oax
[15:41:51] <sudden6> lets see if Travis eats it^^
[15:49:40] <sudden6> aw crap, I set the required version to 0.1.0, but it's not yet set in toxcore...
[15:50:01] <zetok> that's good
[15:50:21] <zetok> (i.e. setting it to what toxcore should have)
[15:50:49] <zetok> btw, it probably should be >=0.1 <0.2
[15:53:06] <sudden6> mhm, but then it would fall through to the old toxcore code and break compilation anyway
[15:53:25] <zetok> um?
[15:53:25] <sudden6> this needs some more thinking overall, but I don't have time/motivation right now
[15:58:21] <iphy> zetok: I think sudden6 means when you try to compile with 0.2 it'll fail because it uses the old toxcore API
[15:58:34] <sudden6> iphy: yes
[15:58:54] <iphy> In reality, it'll fail regardless
[15:59:00] <zetok> err
[15:59:05] <iphy> Because 0.2 is going to break the API without fallback
[15:59:12] <zetok> 0.x – 0.x.y
[15:59:31] <sudden6> zetok: now the condition i >= 0.1.0
[15:59:39] <sudden6> *condition is
[15:59:47] <zetok> ok
[16:00:23] <sudden6> at least that's what I hope the TOX_VERSION_IS_API_COMPATIBLE macro does
[16:00:52] <iphy> The API compatible macro is wrong for 0.x
[16:01:02] <iphy> We could fix that
[16:01:31] <sudden6> that would be pretty helpful
[16:01:51] <iphy> sudden6: make a PR :)
[16:03:40] <iphy> It doesn't block your changes here though
[16:03:55] <iphy> It only starts to matter once 0.2 is out
[16:04:58] <sudden6> I don't see how it's wrong
[16:06:14] <sudden6> wait, can a step from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0 break the API?
[16:06:25] <iphy> Yes
[16:06:47] <iphy> It's the same semantics as without the leading 0
[16:07:46] <sudden6> so this comment: 
[16:07:48] <sudden6>  * The minor version number. Incremented when functionality is added without
[16:07:49] <sudden6>  * breaking the API or ABI. Set to 0 when the major version number is
[16:07:50] <sudden6>  * incremented.
[16:07:52] <sudden6> is wrong?
[16:08:15] <iphy> It assumes 1.x.x
[16:08:43] <iphy> So yes
[16:09:17] <iphy> 0.0.x can break the API on patch increment
[16:09:29] <iphy> Can and did
[16:09:46] <sudden6> ah so 0.x.y is a special cas
[16:09:53] <iphy> Leading zeroes are stripped
[16:10:08] <iphy> After that, the comment is correct
[16:10:21] <sudden6> I think I got it now
