[12:01:54] <sudden6> hi all
[12:20:59] <Diadlo> sudden6: Hi
[12:21:04] <sudden6> hi :)
[12:22:41] <Diadlo> sudden6: Can you test https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3935 ?
[12:22:51] <sudden6> I am already :)
[12:23:08] <Diadlo> Thanks
[12:24:31] <sudden6> commented
[12:25:45] <sudden6> Diadlo: do you have an idea for 4004?
[12:28:40] <Diadlo> I fix it in #3935
[12:29:31] <Diadlo> Hm...
[12:29:32] <sudden6> Diadlo: you fixed it or you are going to fix it?
[12:29:50] <Diadlo> Fixed
[12:30:04] <sudden6> then the fix didn't work for me
[12:30:22] <sudden6> wait, I'm an idiot
[12:30:28] <Diadlo> https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6306608/21471124/6d858448-cabf-11e6-8426-7e9b21cf9c0d.png
[12:30:31] <sudden6> I tested with master *facepalm*
[12:30:35] <Diadlo> :В
[12:30:36] <Diadlo> :D
[12:38:05] <sudden6> Diadlo: 4004 seems fixed for audio calls
[12:38:30] <sudden6> but i think the icon should be a little bit smaller than the buttons
[12:39:16] <Diadlo> About audio-call (both buttons are red). AFAIK, it's old behaviour
[12:39:25] <Diadlo> Isn't it?
[12:40:12] <sudden6> Idk to be honest^^ I just think it's somewhat odd, but if it's old behaviour we should leave it for now, what do you think?
[12:40:39] <zetok> Diadlo: it's not
[12:40:55] <Diadlo> Ok. I will change it
[12:41:02] <zetok> in an audio call video button is greyed out
[12:41:21] <sudden6> zetok: we're speaking about video calls
[12:41:37] <zetok> same thing
[12:41:56] <zetok> one day when qTox will support switching audio↔video call on the go, buttons instead of being greyed out should remain green
[12:42:03] <sudden6> ok then go ahead :)
[12:42:12] <sudden6> one day™
[12:42:16] <sudden6> :D
[12:42:58] <sudden6> has anyone ever seen antis81 in IRC?
[12:43:07] <zetok> long time ago
[12:44:56] <sudden6> :/
[12:45:16] <sudden6> zetok Diadlo the plan about a release today still going?
[12:45:39] <zetok> why wouldn't it?
[12:46:08] <sudden6> dunno, I'm just out of the loop :)
[12:49:28] <zetok> sudden6: why did you add stuff to 1.7 milestone long after the merge window?
[12:50:00] <sudden6> i forgot about the "fixes only" rule, sorry
[12:51:10] <zetok> Diadlo: did you fix the regression in the svg PR?
[12:55:23] <Diadlo> zetok: What kind of regression?
[12:55:46] <zetok> Diadlo: https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3935#issuecomment-267428684

[12:56:34] <Diadlo> zetok: Yes. But I think, now it's same with https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3935#issuecomment-266494453
[12:56:43] <Diadlo> Can you check?
[12:57:01] <zetok> yep
[12:57:06] <zetok> first though translations
[12:57:51] <Diadlo> Sorry, I don't understand
[12:58:12] <Diadlo> What wrong with translations?
[12:58:43] <sudden6> Diadlo: probably nothing, but they should be up to date for the release :)
[12:58:51] <Diadlo> Ok
[13:00:25] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] zetok opened pull request #4005: Update translations from Weblate (master...tr) https://git.io/vMfBd
[13:05:05] <iphy> Merry qTox release day
[13:05:29] <Emcy> wat
[13:06:33] <sudden6> iphy: thx :D
[13:06:53] <iphy> Also Christmas
[13:07:25] <sudden6> who cares about Christmas when it's qTox release day :P
[13:08:23] <zetok> ;)
[13:08:39] <Emcy> no release
[13:08:59] <sudden6> also in my part of the world christmas was celebrated yesterday^^
[13:09:43] <zetok> hmm
[13:09:46] <Diadlo> zetok: What the situation with buttons?
[13:09:54] <zetok> there's something broken
[13:10:09] <zetok> probably not the buttons
[13:10:22] <zetok> sudden6: fix your clients
[13:11:10] <sudden6> better?
[13:12:16] <Diadlo> If I haven't time now, should I create hotfix for #4004?
[13:13:02] <zetok> https://a.uguu.se/LadnKsv362vq.png ← it's interesting how one side sees the contact as offline, while the other claims that they're online and actually in an audio call with them
[13:13:18] <sudden6> Diadlo: You could also tell me where to look and I can try to fix it
[13:13:28] <Diadlo> zetok: It's fixed in my PR
[13:13:43] <zetok> Diadlo: um?
[13:14:09] <Diadlo> sudden6: cherry-pick  ede128b
[13:14:26] <Diadlo> zetok: https://a.uguu.se/LadnKsv362vq.png
[13:14:35] <zetok> um
[13:14:37] <Diadlo> It's fixed in #3935
[13:15:13] <zetok> err
[13:15:34] <Diadlo> Can not be
[13:16:04] <zetok> the qTox instance that claims to have an active call is on your PR
[13:16:47] <zetok> there's at least 1 bug in toxcore at play
[13:17:11] <Diadlo> Sorry, misunderstand bug
[13:17:27] <Diadlo> It's old bug, aren't it?
[13:17:34] <zetok> no
[13:17:35] <Diadlo> *isn't
[13:18:24] <zetok> c-toxcore gained a new regression on top of the old one
[13:18:29] <zetok> sudden6: still not fixed
[13:18:32] <Diadlo> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/2820
[13:18:48] <Diadlo> zetok: ^
[13:18:55] <zetok> yeah, that's an old bug
[13:19:06] <zetok> and the new bug is a regression made on top of the old bug
[13:19:40] <zetok> i.e. with the old bug both sides saw other party as 'offline'
[13:19:49] <Diadlo> Nope
[13:20:07] <sudden6> zetok: I only have one client running
[13:20:24] <zetok> sudden6: hmm
[13:20:51] <zetok> sudden6: oh, nvm
[13:21:14] <sudden6> Diadlo: what is the commit you told me supposed to fix?
[13:21:28] <zetok> sudden6: #4004 ?
[13:21:30] <Diadlo> ede128b
[13:21:42] <Diadlo> Oh, no
[13:21:49] <Diadlo> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3935/commits/7190e173a3ecf1d0319731d7fc49eb801d14c47f
[13:22:04] <Diadlo> It's the new one
[13:22:50] <sudden6> ok
[13:23:24] <iphy> zetok: is it consistently reproducible?
[13:23:39] <zetok> iphy: probably no?
[13:25:17] <zetok> I mean, it happens ~all the time
[13:25:29] <zetok> but I don't know how to reliably reproduce it
[13:25:43] <zetok> the call issue is new though
[13:42:13] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] sudden6 opened pull request #4006: fix(videoButton): Added disabling button while call is active (master...fix4004) https://git.io/vMf0q
[13:42:42] <sudden6> 4004 should be fixed with this ↑
[13:43:17] <iphy> zetok: what is the mean time to failure?
[13:43:26] <iphy> zetok: i.e. how much time do you need to make it happen?
[13:44:49] <zetok> call issue – <3 min perhaps if I'll be able to trigger it again
[13:45:22] <zetok> people appearing as offline – dunno, I don't need to do anything, and it can happen almost any time
[13:47:39] <zetok> latter one probably would happen within 30min-8h
[13:48:35] <zetok> although it's hard to verify, since I don't really know how many of my contacts are actually offline, and how many toxcore shows as offline due to the bug :/
[13:54:58] <sudden6> zetok: when you have time could you check if https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/4006 fixes the call buttons?
[13:56:48] <zetok> :|
[13:57:46] <zetok> sudden6: does it fix it?
[13:57:58] <sudden6> zetok: for me it does
[13:58:06] <zetok> there you go :)
[14:07:16] <sudden6> ok, then I'll merge :)
[14:08:24] <zetok> just make sure to test for regressions :)

[15:21:59] <sudden6> Diadlo: I can try, but I have no idea how to do it^^
[15:22:11] <Diadlo> I'm too
[15:22:55] <Diadlo> I tried add `setIconSize`, but it didn't help
[15:22:58] <sudden6> well, let's take a look at how it's done for the phone and cam icon, there it seems to work
[15:23:07] <Diadlo> Nope
[15:23:12] <Diadlo> There is QPushButton
[15:23:36] <Diadlo> But antis81 suggested to use QToolButtons
[15:24:00] <sudden6> I'll take a look at what's the difference between them in a few min
[15:24:16] <Diadlo> *They are
[15:24:21] <Diadlo> Ok

[15:26:44] <Diadlo> I.e. you are forgotten url :)
[15:27:00] <sudden6> thx, fixed
[15:27:25] <Diadlo> np
[15:28:49] <Diadlo> Also, `copy link` action was added. Maybe we should mention this?
[15:29:01] <Diadlo> It was `P-medium` :)
[15:29:08] <sudden6> Diadlo: feel free to add it :)
[15:29:23] <Diadlo> With my english? :D
[15:29:27] <Diadlo> No, thanks
[15:29:49] <sudden6> I'll fix the English for you^^
[15:30:05] <sudden6> call it learning by making mistakes ;)
[15:30:16] <Diadlo> Ok. After few hours I will try

[16:01:49] <sudden6> Diadlo: I found a way to make the icon smaller, add "padding: 2px;" to the QAbstractButton part of the CSS
[16:06:18] <Diadlo> sudden6: Thank you. Can you push it in your repo? I will cherry-pick it
[16:06:44] <sudden6> I've not made a commit of it, it's just a one line change
[16:07:01] <sudden6> also idk if 2px is a good value
[16:07:29] <Diadlo> We can try 3px too :)
[16:07:35] <sudden6> I used 6px to see a big effect and just guessed from there :D
[16:11:41] <Diadlo> http://i.imgur.com/I8n7Sbn.png
[16:11:56] <Diadlo> Seems icon a bit misplaced
[16:12:24] <sudden6> I don't see anything
[16:12:26] <Diadlo> Mic
[16:12:38] <Diadlo> Not in the center
[16:13:36] <Diadlo> http://i.imgur.com/SscUbwf.png
[16:13:46] <Diadlo> Am I crazy?)
[16:14:49] <sudden6> no, after getting a lineal I see it's out of center by 2px
[16:15:49] <sudden6> maybe "icon-size" is the correct stylesheet property?
[16:17:26] <Diadlo> `icon-size` didn't change anything for me
[16:17:47] <Diadlo> button->setIconSize too
[16:19:56] <sudden6> image-position: center center ?
[16:20:54] <sudden6> I'm out of ideas now, https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet-reference.html#image-prop doesn't have much more to offer :/

[17:00:04] <zetok> well, it's actively maintained
[17:02:00] <sudden6> Diadlo: I still don't fully understand why using '=' is wrong in that context
[17:02:20] <Diadlo> Because it will create copy
[17:02:59] <Diadlo> And call copy constructor
[17:03:59] <Diadlo> `A a(param)` will call only `A(param)` constructor
[17:04:00] <Diadlo> But `A a = A(param)` will call `A(param)` + `A(const A&)`
[17:04:02] <Diadlo> AFAIK
[17:04:23] <sudden6> hmm, I'll look into the docs for that
[17:05:22] <zetok> sudden6, Diadlo: what should I add in `authors` for the post?

[19:27:49] <Diadl0> sudden6: I don't know usecase when we need to set something in toxid
[19:28:00] <Diadl0> So, we need only getters
[19:28:33] <sudden6> Diadl0: yeah, I realized that and am implementing it now :)
[19:29:28] <Diadl0> Good
[19:29:45] <Diadl0> zetok: What with CMake

[21:08:34] <sudden6> zetok: any idea how I can easily verify if qTox-1.7.0.tar.gz contains the same stuff as the git repo?
[21:08:55] <sudden6> and then how we could sign the release tarball?

[22:04:30] <VVD> hi, just upgraded FreeBSD from 10.3 to 11.0, rebuild all ports and found that qTox 1.6.0 can't handle profiles with russian letters
[22:06:50] <VVD> 1.5.1 on FreeBSD 10.3 work fine with profiles with russian letters
[22:08:58] *** Joins: f10 (~flo@ )
[22:10:23] <sudden6> VVD: could you also try with 1.7.0? we just released it today :)
[22:11:13] <sudden6> Diadlo zetok who should sign releases?
[22:11:24] <sudden6> can multiple people sign it?
[22:14:31] <VVD> sudden6, building qTox from ports
[22:15:10] <VVD> only 1.6.0 in ports now
[22:15:20] <sudden6> is this something like the Arch AUR? sorry, I'm not familiar with BSDs
[22:15:42] <sudden6> also what's the log output?
[22:20:29] <VVD> sudden6, don't know that is Arch AUR :-D
[22:20:59] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] sudden6 opened pull request #4011: Remove cdata (master...remove_cdata) https://git.io/vMfPb
[22:21:00] <VVD> https://www.freebsd.org/ports/
[22:21:38] <sudden6> VVD: ok, can you try to compile it yourself?
[22:21:49] <VVD> may be
[22:21:52] <VVD> :-D
[22:22:00] <VVD> url for sources?
[22:22:08] <sudden6> https://github.com/qTox/qTox
[22:22:40] <sudden6> VVD: but first give me the log output, maybe I'll be able to spot the problem
[22:23:15] <VVD> there are a lot of patches for 1.6.0: https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/net-im/qTox/files/
[22:23:29] <VVD> where I can find log?
[22:23:44] <sudden6> run qTox from the terminal
[22:24:09] <sudden6> ok, without these patches for 1.7.0 it'll probably not work
[22:24:20] <VVD> 1st of all in window with list of profiles I don't see russian letters
[22:25:12] <VVD> ����
[22:25:20] <VVD> instead letters
[22:25:38] <VVD> but files have correct names
[22:25:55] <VVD> if I create new profile with name "Тест":
[22:26:02] <sudden6> that's really strange, qTox uses Unicode throughout, so it shouldn't be a problem
[22:26:29] <VVD> 1. files have names: ????.db ????.ini ????.tox Тест.db
[22:26:56] <VVD> 2. in window pick profile I see: ????
[22:27:11] <VVD> it work fine with 1.5
[22:28:26] <sudden6> VVD: I don't think we can solve this right away, could you open a bug report here: https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues
[22:28:27] <VVD> [22:28:18.449 UTC] persistence/profile.cpp:117 : Debug: Loading tox save  "/home/vvd/.config/tox/��������������.tox"
