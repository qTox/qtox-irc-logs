[06:42:41] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] zetok opened pull request #3970: fix(UI): remove unnecessary space between a word and colon (master...fix-colon) https://git.io/v1HW6
[06:44:26] <zetok> Chiitoo: how's file transfer widget going?
[06:45:16] <Chiitoo> Bad!
[06:45:43] <Chiitoo> I noticed the mic etc. button things going off while doing it.
[06:45:47] <Chiitoo> And I thought it was me.
[06:46:07] <Chiitoo> But apparently it's some other change.
[06:46:25] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3935#issuecomment-267428684 hmm
[06:46:31] <Chiitoo> I do have it in mind more or less daily.
[06:47:19] <Chiitoo> yeah, that looks like it.
[06:47:30] <Chiitoo> It's not in my builds either.
[06:50:25] <zetok> the svg icons PR was the only time that I've run into this, I think
[07:04:30] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] zetok opened pull request #3971: chore(travis): use packages from ppas for ffmpeg and libsodium (master...chore-travis-packages) https://git.io/v1HlP
[07:05:49] <zetok> Diadlo: if you have time now for LGTM translations from weblate, I'll pull them and make a PR
[07:06:03] <Chiitoo> I should be able to find out the thing breaking it rather easy.
[07:06:08] <zetok> and once that's merged I'll rebase #3970 with the change
[07:06:11] <Chiitoo> Just'need the time!
[07:06:23] <zetok> Chiitoo: sounds great :)
[07:07:52] <Chiitoo> Hopes so.

[10:49:56] <Diadl0> I think Russian translation has many language mistakes
[10:50:27] <Diadl0> Can you revert it?
[10:50:53] <Diadl0> Or I should fix it?
[10:51:25] <zetok> is it really bad enough to throw away?
[10:52:15] <Diadl0> Hm...
[10:52:33] <zetok> I see the problems with lack of %1
[10:52:55] <Diadl0> Yes
[10:53:15] <Diadl0> It has many small mistakes

[10:59:36] <zetok> Diadl0: I meant that you could just go over the changes from commit and pick the ones that are correct, and discard the ones that are wrong
[10:59:49] <zetok> unless you don't have time
[11:00:47] <Diadl0> How? Locally?
[11:01:13] <zetok> yep

[11:01:33] <zetok> Diadl0: you'll just push the changed stuff
[11:01:49] <Diadl0> Hm...
[11:01:51] <Diadl0> Ok
[11:01:53] <Diadl0> I will try
[11:02:13] <zetok> git remote add zetok https://github.com/zetok/qTox
[11:02:32] <zetok> git fetch zetok

[11:03:22] <zetok> hmm
[11:04:58] <zetok> ok
[11:05:05] <zetok> git reset HEAD^
[11:05:33] <zetok> Diadl0: with that you have non-committed changes
[11:06:13] <zetok> Diadl0: git add --patch translations/ru.ts
[11:06:21] <Diadl0> Yes. I know all this. But what next?
[11:07:08] <zetok> once you've picked the changes, continue the rebase, and force push to my branch
[11:07:33] <Diadl0> I can just push in you repo? O_o

[11:08:11] <zetok> https://a.uguu.se/BLgJYChoYIiS.png
[11:08:52] <zetok> btw, `git reset HEAD^` is after the translation commit is set to `edit` in rebase
[11:09:43] <zetok> `git commit -c ORIG_HEAD` after the changes have been added

[20:22:54] <zetok> Diadlo: `git push -f zetok tr`
[20:24:52] <zetok> um, there was no need to fix the translation
[20:25:13] <zetok> just picking parts that were good and discarding the rest would do

[21:50:33] <zetok> tux3: o/
[21:50:43] <tux3> zetok, hai!
[21:51:50] <zetok> tux3: https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3968 ‚Üê seems like it would be good to have a portable zip with a settings files included that is already set to portable
[21:51:55] <zetok> what do you think?
[21:52:11] <zetok> file*
[21:52:12] <tux3> Yeah, that sounds good. It shouldn't be hard to do either
[21:52:40] <tux3> Probably, someone just needs to create a Jenkins job for it
[21:53:06] <zetok> hmm
[21:53:45] <tux3> Oh are there already qTox portable builds?
[21:54:08] * zetok just had an idea how jenkins config could be made to be possible to contribute to by anyone
[21:54:27] <zetok> tux3: there are .zip builds that people consider to be "portable"
[21:54:43] <zetok> :|
[21:55:11] <tux3> qTox should check on startup if there's a setting file in the local folder, and only if it isnt there create the settings in the user profile
[21:55:37] <tux3> So that issue makes it sound like either that code is broken or the portable builds don't have a setting files with them ?
[21:56:14] <zetok> yeah, zip builds don't have that file
[21:56:38] <zetok> (+ there is a bug, but that's a separate issue)
[21:56:42] <tux3> Who makes those portable builds?
