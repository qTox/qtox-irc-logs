[06:37:04] <zetok> btw, C++ doesn't really have support for real™ macros, right?
[06:37:36] <zetok> ↑ that's the conclusion that I came to, after seeing settings.cpp
[06:38:10] <zetok> i.e. almost all of settings.cpp could be implemented using a single Rust macro

[06:39:20] <Diadlo> And yes, most part of settings can be replaced by macro

[17:11:25] <sudden6> bennabiy: nurupo mentioned he will gladly accept guest texts

[17:11:36] <sudden6> ;)
[17:11:37] <zetok> har har.
[17:12:15] * bennabiy sighs
[17:15:28] <bennabiy> thanks for the link
[17:15:37] <zetok> np
[17:21:46] <bennabiy> hrm, qTox toxcore version: 0.0.0 ?
[17:22:13] <bennabiy> You are using qTox version v1.6.0-obs.
[17:22:24] <cisc> zetok: trying compiling of qtox on openSUSE atm, got this error: No provider of 'libffmpeg-devel' found.
[17:22:42] <sudden6> cisc: try ffmpeg-devel
[17:23:01] <sudden6> reminds me to recheck that
[17:23:05] <cisc> k
[17:23:39] <cisc> that exists
[17:24:18] <zetok> bennabiy: https://github.com/abbat/tox.pkg ← one can make a PR :|
[17:32:46] <cisc> zetok: also, qmake package isn't listed in install.md for opensuse
[17:33:07] <zetok> cisc: would you mind adding it?
[17:34:49] <cisc> yeah I cat
[17:34:53] <cisc> *can
[17:38:53] <cisc> cnf qmake: `Try installing with zypper install libqt4-devel`
[17:39:06] <cisc> that is the wrong qmake
[17:40:19] <cisc> libqt4-devel exists, libqt5-devel doesn't
[17:48:48] <cisc> ahh its probably in libqt5-qtbase-devel
[17:49:12] <cisc> nope

[19:31:07] <Diadlo> bennabiy: Hello\
[19:31:30] <Diadlo> Just write your server address in `server` field
[19:35:05] <bennabiy> I did, but it times out
[19:35:17] <bennabiy> Diadlo: does it support server:port ?
[19:35:37] <bennabiy> and does it default to port 8080?
[19:36:09] *** Quits: f10 (~flo@ ) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[19:37:52] <Diadlo> Hm... AFAIR, yes
[19:38:14] <Diadlo> I will take a look after few minutes
[19:39:19] <bennabiy> I was trying to track down where the default is set
[19:39:30] <bennabiy> but did not honestly spend too much time looking into it
[19:40:08] <bennabiy> now, for server, it must match the same as what is set in the toxme config file for registration domain?
[19:41:15] <bennabiy> or put another way,  username@registration_domain ... registration_domain = server?
[19:41:34] <bennabiy> which must match http://server/u/username?
[19:41:57] <bennabiy> err https://
[19:41:58] <Diadlo> bennabiy: Can you share your servername?
[19:42:20] <Diadlo> I.e. address 
[19:42:34] <bennabiy> Diadlo: one moment, I will fire up a different instance
[19:42:40] <Diadlo> Ok
[19:47:42] <bennabiy> Diadlo: actually, if I move the toxme.db and reinitialize the db, it will remove private data, correct?
[19:48:10] <Diadlo> I don't know how toxme works inside
[19:48:23] <Diadlo> But I think, you are right
[19:52:30] <bennabiy> hmm
[19:52:49] <bennabiy> old userinfo is still there
[19:53:29] <Diadlo> Is it matter now?
[19:55:45] <bennabiy> are you going to be around for a little bit?
[19:56:08] <Diadlo> Yes
[19:56:14] <Diadlo> I hope :|
[19:57:18] <bennabiy> ok, I will message you when I am ready
[19:57:26] <Diadlo> Ok
[19:57:44] <bennabiy> I hope you do not mind, but I do not really want my production server to be known to the public, so I am spinning up a new one to test
[19:58:39] <Diadlo> Do you understand, that to share your toxme in the future you will share your server address?
[19:59:19] *** Joins: Dragofix- (Dragofix@ )
[19:59:39] <Diadlo> There is no reason to have a toxme server and hide it
[20:00:29] <Diadlo> It's like create site and don't tell anyone it's address :)
[20:01:18] <bennabiy> Diadlo: it is for internal listings
[20:01:30] <Diadlo> Ok
[20:02:21] <bennabiy> Diadlo: I understand the principle behind toxme, but I would like to implement it for within our organization for being able to keep a private list of tox addresses, without making those addresses known to those outside our group
[20:02:24] <bennabiy> make sense?
[20:02:36] <bennabiy> otherwise I would just use the toxme.io
[20:02:48] <Diadlo> Yes. It's make sense

[20:56:21] <sudden6> Diadlo: I just refactored 30% of Core :S
[20:57:36] <bennabiy> when adding a friend from a private toxme server, does it have to be https?
[20:57:51] <sudden6> bennabiy: yes
[20:57:55] <bennabiy> ok
[20:58:09] <sudden6> at least without it it would be very dangerous
[20:58:31] <bennabiy> anyone with advice on how to set up nginx in front of tornado with ssl?
[20:59:22] <sudden6> IDK what tornado is, but for nginx you can probably take the setup from letsencrypt with your own certificate
[20:59:46] <bennabiy> sudden6: ok
[21:00:50] <bennabiy> sudden6: best I can tell, a non-blocking web server
[21:01:29] <bennabiy> it is what is used for the toxme frontend

[21:07:50] <Diadlo> Ok
[21:08:36] <sudden6> Also what I did will need at least 2-3 review passes, by then 4001 will already be merged
[21:09:27] <Diadlo> I'm afraid of merging 4001
[21:09:44] <sudden6> because?
[21:10:10] <Diadlo> It has to many changes in important part of code
