[09:35:19] <zetok> oh
[09:35:55] <zetok> Diadlo_: toxcore is initially cloned with `--depth=1`
[09:36:17] * zetok wonders whether perhaps a tarball should be used
[09:37:08] <zetok> it probably should
[09:39:45] *** Joins: f10 (~flo@ )
[09:40:47] <Diadlo_> Where I can found it?
[09:44:11] <Diadlo_> Seems, I found it (https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/archive/v0.1.0.tar.gz)
[09:46:16] <Diadlo_> Should I use tarball only in osx build?
[09:46:57] <zetok> it could be used everywhere
[09:47:29] <zetok> Diadlo_: oh wait :/
[09:47:46] <zetok> Diadlo_: sorry, I didn't think too well about that
[09:48:14] <zetok> Diadlo_: the problem with osx script is that it allows for updating, and that includes also toxcore updates
[09:48:27] <zetok> one does not have that with a tarball
[09:49:43] <Diadlo_> May be just remove `--depth=1` ?
[09:49:51] <zetok> mm
[09:50:03] <zetok> that'll work, but it'll require more bandwidth
[09:50:43] <Diadlo_> Ok. What about fetch/pull tags>
[09:50:44] <Diadlo_> ,
[09:50:46] <Diadlo_> *?

[09:52:28] <zetok> AFAIK one does not do that
[09:52:41] <Diadlo_> Ok
[09:54:50] <Diadlo_> Done
[09:55:05] <Diadlo_> git clone --branch v0.1.0 --depth=1
[09:55:13] <Diadlo_> zetok: ^
[09:55:31] <zetok> Of course it's a branch.
[09:55:36] * zetok facepalms
[09:55:49] <zetok> well, good to know :)
[09:57:14] <Diadlo_> Could I do it in separate PR?
[09:57:33] <Diadlo_> Oh.. no, sorry
[10:09:25] <Chiitoo> zetok: There might be a bug for you to comment on.  :]  Here: https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=590912
[10:10:24] <zetok> Chiitoo: not assigned to me, I don't care
[10:13:15] <Chiitoo> Okies.
[10:13:52] <zetok> Chiitoo: the only bug that has been assigned to me and I didn't close yet has my comment on it :)
[10:14:39] <iphy> --branch can clone tags as well
[10:14:47] <Chiitoo> Mhm.  I did notice it wasn't assigned, but didn't want to comment on it myself at least before asking you.

[19:47:22] <Diadlo> zetok: Does it lgty?
[19:47:26] <Diadlo> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3736
[19:47:53] <zetok> haven't tested yet aside from compiling
[19:51:49] <zetok> btw, are all those ifdefs really needed?
[19:52:34] <zetok> just something that I've been wondering about
[19:52:52] <zetok> i.e. if API would not be compatible, it would fail to compile anyway, right?
[19:58:18] <Diadlo> Hm... 
[19:59:10] <Diadlo> 1) In theory, it should be compiled as well with old toxcore
[19:59:25] <iphy> I gave up on that
[19:59:27] <iphy> in tox4j
[19:59:45] <Diadlo> 2) With full migration on new version we can remove it
[20:03:22] <zetok> Diadlo: um?
[20:03:31] <zetok> Diadlo: I don't understand point 1
[20:03:59] <zetok> btw, I found a bug in that can result in making a video call without user's consent
[20:04:36] <Diadlo> About 1. Nevermind
[20:04:40] <zetok> what's interesting, I can reproduce it only on the TokTok migration PR
[20:06:46] <iphy> that is interesting
[20:06:46] <zetok> steps to reproduce: 1. Q1 makes an audio call to Q2; 2. Q2 picks up; 3. when audio call is ongoing, quickly end it on Q2 side and press video call button; 4. Q2 made a video call to Q1 without Q1's consent
[20:09:41] <Diadlo> zetok: Can you test it with utox?
[20:09:50] <zetok> nope
[20:10:03] <Diadlo> Why?
[20:10:36] <Diadlo> Ok. I will test it tomorrow
[20:11:49] <zetok> Diadlo: https://gist.github.com/zetok/207747f7330be5592f82cae9300ee7bf
[20:12:02] <zetok> because of ÂµTox maintainer
[20:12:16] <zetok> I don't want to use this software
[20:12:23] <zetok> and I see no reason to do so
[20:13:13] <Diadlo> "Perfect"
