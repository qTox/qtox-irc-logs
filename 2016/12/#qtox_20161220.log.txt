[05:30:21] <nurupo> want me to approve it?
[05:30:46] <nurupo> i'm not sure if it will fix the build or not
[05:31:04] <nurupo> maybe some other flag added in meantime also breaks it
[05:31:05] <zetok> um, just linked to you what probably will fix the windows build
[05:31:12] <nurupo> ok
[05:31:17] <zetok> um, ~nothing else was added
[05:32:35] <zetok> and given that compiling failed at linking, that's the only change that could have broken it
