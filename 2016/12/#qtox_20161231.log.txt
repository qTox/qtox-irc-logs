[10:18:23] <reBrain> why's updating not working on Windows 7?
[10:18:37] <reBrain> or any Windows actually?
[10:54:56] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] zetok opened pull request #4031: docs(INSTALL): correct instruction for toxcore tag checkout (master...docs-install-tagtox) https://git.io/vMts5
[11:16:06] <robinli> zetok: ^
[11:16:08] <robinli> Got any idea? :x
[11:27:05] <zetok> yeah
[11:27:08] <zetok> bug in updater
[11:27:25] <zetok> + there's no 1.7 build for windows
[11:27:57] <zetok> (it's written in blog post)
[11:34:08] <robinli> Ah, okay.
[11:34:14] <robinli> Got the bug fixed?
[11:34:32] <robinli> Oh.
[11:34:47] <robinli> reBrain: https://qtox.github.io/blog/2016/12/25/Autoupdater-bug-and-v1.7.0-release.html
[12:17:15] <reBrain> oh thanks
[12:19:51] <robinli> No worried. :)
[12:20:06] <robinli> So it should be fine if you just manually download the latest version.

[18:37:40] <cisc> when I compiled & ran qTox 1.7 with toxcore 0.0.2 & added echobot@toxme.io, and an offline contact showed up in the contact list as a string of zeros. any known issue?
[18:39:24] <zetok> cisc: no
[18:39:29] <zetok> cisc: you should open an issue
[18:39:36] <zetok> on toktok
[18:40:21] <cisc> however everything else worked fine including audio and video, and a test call
[18:41:11] <cisc> well first I was gonna make a PR when I have the chance and make some mods to the install.md about installing on suse
[18:42:15] <cisc> and try to reproduce on 42.2, the string of zeros being returned happened on a Tumblweed box
[19:18:57] <zetok> os is irrelevant
[19:19:10] <zetok> there was a change in toxcore that touched that area
[19:56:38] <iphy> cisc: can you reproduce it?

[21:11:13] *** Quits: GGMethos (methos@ ) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[21:19:44] <cisc> I didn't have notifications enabled on this tab accidentally. iphy: I will try again and see if I can reproduce
[21:20:21] <iphy> string of zeroes?
[21:20:31] <iphy> as in a string containing '0' characters?
[21:20:40] <cisc> exactly
[21:20:44] <iphy> how many?
[21:20:46] <cisc> like 0000000000000000
[21:20:51] <cisc> I am not sure exactly
[21:21:01] <iphy> that's an odd bug
[21:21:11] <iphy> would be nice if we can reproduce it
[21:21:26] <cisc> I will try again and give a screenshot or whatever debug log needed
[21:21:51] <iphy> a sequence of steps to reproduce would be most helpful
[21:22:25] <cisc> I added groupbot@toxme.io, and what showed up on the list was an offline contact with the name `0000000000000000`
[21:23:03] <cisc> can anyone else reproduce?

[22:31:17] <noelr> The binary download of qtox for windows is 1.6.0 instead of the newest 1.7.1. Somebody should update the link on the github page.
[22:36:38] <Emcy_> there is no windows binary for it
[23:30:24] *** Quits: Yoshimo (~anything@ ) (Quit: Yoshimo)
[23:34:07] <noelr> Emcy_: will there be one or is windows an abandoned platform?
[23:39:10] <Emcy_> i doubt its abandoned
[23:39:35] <Emcy_> but the main maintainter didnt seem to give much of a fuck when i asked him
[23:40:00] <Emcy_> they use a different build system for everything apart from windows now
[23:46:47] <noelr> I'd love to convince a bunch of people to use qTox as part of new year resolution. Would be handy if qTox for windows was updated...
[23:46:57] <noelr> especially given that autoupdates dont work in qTox <1.7.0
[23:48:59] <Emcy_> it will be done eventually
[23:50:04] <Emcy_> we all wish tox wasnt still so shitty to present to friends
[23:51:23] <noelr> tox is the best anyway
[23:51:52] <noelr> just like we endure linux even though the UX is still crappy
[23:52:15] <Emcy_> thats not a comforting comparison
[23:52:29] <noelr> yeah I guess you're right
