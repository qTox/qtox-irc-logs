[20:01:45] <Diadl0> zetok: ping
[20:05:07] <zetok> Diadl0: pong
[20:05:46] <Diadl0> I'm try to fix #3935 can you test it?
[20:06:34] <zetok> yeah
[20:09:06] <Diadl0> zetok: Seems fixed?
[20:09:39] <zetok> kinda
[20:12:20] <zetok> Diadl0: I wonder about the buttons not being greyed-out
[20:13:03] <Diadl0> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3935#issuecomment-264703466
[20:13:16] <Diadl0> Maybe I misunderstood you
[20:13:21] <zetok> right
[20:14:25] <Diadl0> Should I make it gray?
[20:14:48] <Diadl0> Also, please, try again
[20:15:12] <zetok> it should be grey if it can't be used
[20:15:30] <zetok> and right now it can't be used outside of call
[20:18:03] <Diadl0> Should I enable them?
[20:18:36] <zetok> will that work?
[20:18:53] <zetok> (if yes, then they should be enabled)
[20:19:07] * zetok can't find the issue for it
[20:20:31] *** Quits: Yoshimo (~anything@ ) (Quit: Yoshimo)
[20:21:03] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/838
[20:21:30] <Diadl0> For me disabling buttons, when call is disabled seems right. But ok, I will try
[20:22:07] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/1395
[20:22:19] <zetok> the other option would be to https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/1372
[20:22:56] <zetok> but #1372 would equal to lack of functionality
