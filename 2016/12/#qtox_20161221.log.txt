[02:00:47] <zetok> iphy: um, why close the PR?
[02:00:59] <iphy> because apparently it's supposed to work without that
[02:01:09] <iphy> the packages are there
[02:01:13] <zetok> dunno about that
[02:29:47] <nurupo> zetok: now windows builds fail because of incorrect toktok toxcore linking
[02:30:25] <nurupo> they either don't link to all of the static libs, or link in the wrong order (not sure if order actually matters for static linking)
[02:31:36] <zetok> link to log?
[02:33:23] <nurupo> https://build.tox.chat/job/qTox_build_windows_x86-64_release/954/console

[03:02:29] <nurupo> zetok: does the qmake file link against libtoxfriends.a libtoxdht.a libtoxnetcrypto.a and other "layer" libraries toktok toxcore has introduced?
[03:04:12] <nurupo> nope, it doesn't
[03:04:48] <nurupo> *i think* the build will get fixed if we link against the rest of tox* static libs in here https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/qtox.pro#L181
[03:06:00] <nurupo> the list of all missing libs is libtoxcrypto.a libtoxdht.a libtoxfriends.a libtoxgroup.a libtoxmessenger.a libtoxnetcrypto.a libtoxnetwork.a
[03:06:16] <nurupo> not sure if order matters
[03:07:09] <zetok> :s
[03:07:18] <zetok> ok
[03:07:41] <zetok> order probably doesn't matter
[03:08:29] <zetok> hmm
[03:08:46] <zetok> > /usr/lib64/libtoxav.a
[03:08:50] <zetok> > /usr/lib64/libtoxcore.a
[03:08:54] <nurupo> trying to patch qtox.pro to check it
[03:09:09] <zetok> this is going to be fun.
[03:09:44] <zetok> i.e. from what I understand, only cmake toxcore build has those libs split
[03:10:20] <zetok> while autotools build still offers the "old" static libs
[03:10:38] <nurupo> we use cmake on jenkins
[03:10:42] <zetok> yes
[03:10:52] <zetok> and I use autotools, since there are no docs for cmake
[03:11:37] <nurupo> this affects only static linking, i think
[03:11:57] <zetok> yeah
[03:12:17] <zetok> iphy: 0.2 should remove autotools support
[03:12:22] <nurupo> if you build toxcore as a shared library, do you still get .so for each toxcore layer? i'm not sure, but i think you don't
[03:30:42] <iphy> nurupo: yes you do
[03:38:51] <nurupo> zetok: qmake complains on https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/qtox.pro#L57
[03:39:33] <zetok> hm?
[03:39:49] <nurupo> Could not find qmake configuration directoryCould not find qmake configuration fileUsing OS scope before setting MAKEFILE_GENERATOR/home/jenkins/workspace/qTox_build_windows_x86-64_release/qtox/qtox.pro(57): Using OS scope before setting MAKEFILE_GENERATOR
[03:41:40] <zetok> I see
[03:43:07] <nurupo> seems like it should be fine
[03:43:37] <nurupo> don't understand why qmake complains
[03:43:50] <nurupo> those also seem to be several concurrent outputs
[03:44:22] <nurupo> Could not find qmake configuration directory, Could not find qmake configuration file, Using OS scope before setting MAKEFILE_GENERATOR
[03:45:29] <zetok> probably moving it under https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/qtox.pro#L190 would help
[04:28:45] <nurupo> not sure how to fix it, it seems like it still doesn't link to those tox .a libraries even though i edited qtox.pro
[04:29:29] <nurupo> i have undone all my changes i did now and emailing to tux3 :\

[09:09:31] <parasite_> I currently need to downgrade to 1.4.1-4 to use it, what should i do to use the latest version correctly?
[09:10:25] <zetok> os?

[09:25:18] <zetok> there you go.
[09:26:12] <zetok> parasite_: you might want to check if something in your env doesn't set incorrect variables, and if that's not the case, it would be good to make fill a bug against Qt

[22:35:27] <zetok> Gottox: it should be updated to at least 1.6 (or 1.7 in a week), description, website, distfiles link, `do_install()` should use `make install` with specified (IIRC) PREFIX
[22:37:45] <zetok> Gottox: I could make a diff with changes, but someone would need to check & test it :)
[22:39:26] <Gottox> feel free. I'm going to test/include it tomorrow.
[22:40:23] <zetok> checksum is sha256 ?
[22:40:53] <Gottox> yea
[22:42:08] <zetok> actually
[22:43:54] <zetok> Gottox: https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/blob/master/net-im/qtox/qtox-1.6.0.ebuild
[22:45:29] <zetok> Gottox: would that be enough?
[22:45:35] <Gottox> yea :)
[22:46:00] <Gottox> I'm going to include that tomorrow. it's nearly 12pm here and tomorrow is full of pre-chrismas stuff :)
[22:46:09] <zetok> ok
[22:46:25] <zetok> sounds great :)
[22:47:40] <Gottox> thanks for your help! 
[22:47:52] <zetok> btw, if you require in template a www instead of github, use https://qtox.github.io/
[22:49:14] <zetok> and if you're interested in maintaining qTox template for Void, I could include you in a list of people to ping about breaking changes in qTox
[22:49:34] <zetok> (subscribing to qTox-dev mailing list also would do)
[22:52:07] <zetok> e.g. qTox 1.7 will depend on TokTok/c-toxcore
[22:53:11] <Gottox> a ping of breaking changes would be awesome. We have a full automatic system for notifications on updates and we notice when a build breaks, but we won't notice removed dependencies.
[22:54:10] <zetok> >filteraudio-devel-git
[22:54:14] <zetok> that one is gone :)
[22:54:22] <zetok> >libopencv-devel

[22:55:27] <oranges> rest in peace filteraudio
[22:56:05] <Gottox> okay, I'm afk for now. will be back tomorrow. thanks for your helpful feedback :)
