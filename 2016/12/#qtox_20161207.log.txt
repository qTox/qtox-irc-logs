[00:22:25] <zetok> Chiitoo: ping, are you still onto filetransfer widget?
[00:28:02] <Chiitoo> It still is oft in my mind, and I might even finally be able to do something about it soon.  None of the new changes have been blocking me rebasing the original changes, so there shouldn't be issues like that either.
[00:28:22] <Chiitoo> It will remain to be seen if it's even close to an appropriate way of doing them things.  :D
[00:28:42] <Chiitoo> (Or if people even want it.)
[00:29:10] <zetok> um, did you want to do something more than just moving the buttons a bit?
[00:29:15] * zetok doesn't remember by now
[00:29:56] <Chiitoo> Mainly it was the buttons only, yeah.  At most, the margins also, but probably no.

[01:02:46] *** Joins: f10_ (~flo@ )
[01:11:33] <zetok> :|
[01:12:28] <tux3> ?
[01:15:50] <zetok> weird, I couldn't copy link and now I can't reproduce
[01:15:56] <tux3> uh
[01:16:26] <zetok> actually, nvm, I can ~reproduce
[01:16:43] <zetok> for some reason pasting with ctrl+v doesn't always work
[01:16:57] <zetok> pasting via r-click menu works
[01:17:26] <tux3> Can't repro. Is it only for links, or also if you select and right click copy?
[01:17:39] <zetok> what is weird, is that ctrl+v copying doesn't want to work reliably for links
[01:18:00] <tux3> That's super weird, and probably that would be a Qt bug :/
[01:18:14] <zetok> and copying starts working after removing & restoring focus to qTox window
[01:18:28] <zetok> a second Qt bug in ~24h :f
[01:19:43] <tux3> It's weird because I can't repro
[01:20:10] <tux3> If you ^V in another application, it works though?
[01:21:07] <zetok> yep
[01:21:32] <zetok> focus change is all that it takes to make it work
[01:21:36] <tux3> Welp
[01:22:16] <zetok> btw, I'm copying link by not clicking on link directly, but rather, on the empty space between link lines that is still classified as "link"
[01:22:34] <zetok> (that probably doesn't matter)
[01:24:01] <zetok> meanwhile, I think that I've found a link that qTox doesn't detect as such
[01:24:20] <zetok> or maybe not
[01:24:43] <tux3> If it's highlighted and you can't copy it, that's my fault and I have no idea how that could happen :)
[01:24:58] <tux3> If it's not highlighted, blame QTextDocument being weird
[01:25:23] <tux3> I think it just looks for http:// or another protocol://
[01:25:52] <zetok> no, it detect link just fine so far
[01:26:19] <zetok> just less decided that breaking up 300+ char link into separate lines is a good idea
[01:26:28] <tux3> Heh
[01:27:45] <zetok> it works
[01:27:47] <tux3> Well I could fix that probably
[01:30:05] <tux3> Nah you're right it work
[01:30:12] <tux3> works*
[01:31:06] <tux3> Alright imma go catch some Zs, nigh

[17:34:15] <Chiitoo> Not really.  Whyes?
[17:34:44] <Chiitoo> I could perhaps do it really quick-like, since I do use the change in my builds, but I was hoping to maybe get some adjustments done before.
[17:34:53] <Chiitoo> Of course, getting it out there would help getting comments on it at least.

[19:21:08] <Chiitoo> Looks like the least I should do, is remove the old things I left in commented out, as reminders.  Good thing I did, because I would not remember the whats and whyes otherwise... probably.
[19:26:59] <Chiitoo> Ahhh, of course there's something I didn't think of yet.  There are some references in the code to 'topButton' and 'bottomButton', which I never changed.  So while it works, the names are now somewhat... unaccurate.  So to fix that, there's more work to be done.  :\
