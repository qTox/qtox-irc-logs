[00:22:54] <craigbass76> Is there any way to sign on with my desktop, then my laptop, but be the same person? I've got the same username/pass on both computers, btu I'm not seeing the two people on my laptop that I "friended" today on my desktop.
[00:25:57] <zetok> >I've got the same username/pass on both computers
[00:26:05] <zetok> this is local-only stuff
[00:26:34] <zetok> craigbass76: you can, but for time being it requires making sure that things are kept in sync
[00:27:22] <zetok> craigbass76: sync your profile directory between boxes
[00:27:30] <craigbass76> so if I rsync stuff over from the PC to the laptop, that should work? Can I have it open on both bexes at once?
[00:27:33] <craigbass76> boxes...
[00:28:28] <zetok> >Can I have it open on both bexes at once?
[00:28:33] <zetok> you can, but it won't work well
[00:28:45] <zetok> also, beware https://github.com/qTox/qTox/wiki/FAQ#how-to-merge-two-profiles-of-the-same-id-synchronize-contacts-and-history
[00:29:37] <zetok> craigbass76: I probably would suggest trying out syncthing

[22:41:30] <zetok> tux3: um, I was wondering if you plan to do anything regarding updating mechanism
[22:41:50] <zetok> tux3: i.e. current one seems to be a bit fragile, and you were saying something about a rewrite
[22:42:07] <tux3> zetok, I'm considering the idea, but that seems likely to introduce regressions
[22:42:14] <zetok> I see
[22:42:17] <tux3> There's also those pre-made update frameworks
[22:42:47] <tux3> For now I'm thinking adding unit tests would do more good than rewriting things
[22:43:05] <tux3> Since that would have caught this particular bug quite trivially..
[22:43:10] <zetok> right
[22:43:32] <zetok> do you plan to write unit test(s?) for that?
[22:45:00] <tux3> That downright garbage serialization code that I copypasted from another project 2 years ago, it needs to be thoroughly tested and maybe rewritten, because I know for a fact it's positively awful :)
[22:45:22] <tux3> For the updater itself, tests would be good but less urgent
[22:45:31] <tux3> I don't have any concrete plans right now
[22:45:37] <zetok> ok
[22:45:49] <zetok> um, it would be nice to have it in qTox before 1.7 release
[22:46:19] <zetok> so that we could say that problem has been fixed, and from now on we will have tests that would detect problems
[22:46:27] <zetok> before they hit the users
[22:46:46] <zetok> (1.7 is to be released on 25)
[22:47:00] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3910#issuecomment-265296459
[22:47:04] <zetok> >Update
[22:47:14] <zetok> :|
[22:47:58] <zetok> and if not, then for the next release
[22:48:07] <tux3> I'm pretty frustrated that the updater broke, again. Unfortunately I don't know if I'll have the time & motivation to sit down and fix all of that
[22:48:19] <zetok> I see
[22:48:32] <oranges> doesn't windows have a package manager now
[22:48:33] <oranges> just use that
[22:48:36] <oranges> it's about time
[22:48:38] <zetok> it doesn't
[22:48:45] <zetok> it's called windows store
[22:48:54] <zetok> but it's limited & useless
[22:49:12] <tux3> ^
[22:50:24] <tux3> Wasn't there a plan in the works to switch to CMake btw?
[22:50:33] <zetok> yep, it's WIP
[22:50:41] <tux3> That could change how we do the unit tests
[22:50:44] <tux3> In a good way
[22:50:47] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3913
[22:50:49] <oranges> no I mean teh other thingy
[22:50:54] <zetok> oranges: oh?
[22:51:13] <oranges> I hope I didn't hallucinate it
[22:51:26] <oranges> OneGet!
[22:51:35] <oranges> http://www.howtogeek.com/200334/windows-10-includes-a-linux-style-package-manager-named-oneget/
[22:51:39] <tux3> I had heard of NuGet but that's a MSVC thing
[22:52:39] <tux3> Oh it actually looks pretty neat
[22:52:53] <tux3> Without a UI I don't know how many people use it though. And Win10 only..

[23:06:52] <tux3> zetok, not sure I know the answer
[23:07:09] * zetok half-expected that
[23:07:13] <zetok> no problem
[23:07:18] <tux3> Is there a WIP PR that goes with that issue?
