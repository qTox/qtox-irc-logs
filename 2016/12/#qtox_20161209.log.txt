[03:22:28] <nurupo> you could try make your tox avatar be a live webcam feed for funzies

[03:22:53] <nurupo> update the avatar several times per second with the most recent image from webcam
[03:22:55] <zetok> qTox wouldn't be able to handle that
[03:22:59] <nurupo> or some some other video input
[03:23:24] <zetok> it sends avatar only once(!!!) per friend per qTox instance start

[03:23:50] <nurupo> huh?
[03:24:16] <nurupo> if you change your avatar, your friends won't see it until you restart qTox?
[03:24:21] <zetok> yep
[03:24:54] <zetok> :/
[03:25:06] <nurupo> that's weird

[04:28:16] <nurupo> also, how do you even review this? +7,693 −1,087 
[04:28:30] <zetok> well, all that you need to do is to `:lgtm:`
[04:28:43] <nurupo> are you a devil? D:
[04:29:44] <zetok> um, it doesn't really need review
[04:29:50] <nurupo> "can you review this?" "you don't actually have to review it, just sign off that you have reviewed it"
[04:29:53] <zetok> it needs a `:lgtm:`
[04:30:08] <nurupo> yeah, that's what it sounds like
[04:30:18] <nurupo> that it doesn't actually need a review
[04:30:18] <zetok> generally, no one reviews translations
[04:30:40] <zetok> except for Diadlo, who has found quite a few things not quite right
[04:32:25] <nurupo> there you go
[04:32:56] <zetok> thanks
[04:33:09] <nurupo> i don't really like lgtm'ing things without actually reviewing them, please don't ask me to do this anymore

[13:44:57] <robinli> http://changelog.reviewable.io/.gitattributes-support-13109
[13:46:47] <zetok> I see
[13:46:49] <zetok> :s
[13:47:08] <zetok> it's not really good though
[13:47:50] <zetok> i.e. disabling diffs doesn't sound quite right
[13:51:50] <robinli> zetok: Might be useful for generated files.
[13:52:12] * zetok wonders if there are any
[13:52:33] <robinli> Isn't the tox.api.h generated from other files?
[13:53:01] <zetok> it is, but it shouldn't be hidden from review

[19:15:53] <zetok> (at least the stuff that you've commented on)
[19:16:07] <zetok> would be good to fix it now
[19:16:50] <Diadlo> Yes :)
[19:19:49] <zetok> sudden6: I've got the rebasing script for all PRs working
[19:20:32] <sudden6> you have my attention ;)
[19:21:14] <zetok> I wrote a bit of rust that pulls the info about all open PRs from github, and I've plugged that into a script
[19:21:46] <zetok> https://gist.github.com/zetok/bd7fc53d8fba257b0dcd970a8d8ca928 ← script output
[19:23:12] <zetok> https://gist.github.com/zetok/a054f6214439681969331f1cbf29c401 ← script that works on the output
[19:23:36] <zetok> right now gopull is hardcoded to qTox/qTox repo
[19:23:52] <sudden6> mhm, I see
[19:25:08] <zetok> I guess I'll put it on gh after adding toml support for configurable repos
[19:25:22] <zetok> (unless you want to use it right now with hardcoded qTox repo)
[19:26:36] <sudden6> no thanks, I'll wait till you're satisfied with it
[19:26:52] <zetok> it works, and I'm fairly satisfied
[19:27:07] <zetok> uhm, kinda
[19:27:57] <zetok> the only thing that I couldn't get to work was proxy support, since hyper (lib used for ~connections) doesn't support https over http proxies (yet)
[19:28:18] <zetok> :/
