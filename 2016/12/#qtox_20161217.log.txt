[07:04:29] <Diadlo> zetok: When I click video-call button after stop audio-call it take at least few second to start video and it's works as usual
[07:04:38] <zetok> hmm
[07:04:45] <zetok> I don't have that delay
[07:05:25] <Diadlo> Both clients on one machine
[07:06:04] <zetok> yep
[07:09:05] <zetok> Diadlo: if you want I can make a webm
[07:09:32] <zetok> it's easily reproducible
[07:09:57] <zetok> https://a.uguu.se/KvqzRZiVcnrM.png :D
[07:11:37] <Diadlo> You can try. But I think I reproduce it correctly and problem with my PC/network/etc.
[07:12:30] <Diadlo> Heeey
[07:12:33] <Diadlo> zetok: 
[07:12:34] <Diadlo> Ups
[07:13:07] <Diadlo> zetok: I think, I know reason of issue
[07:13:12] <zetok> har har.
[07:13:16] <Diadlo> https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/221
[07:13:23] * zetok "found" the package that was missing in travis config
[07:13:38] <zetok> `libx264-dev` ?!
[07:13:48] <Diadlo> May be
[07:14:09] <zetok> hum
[07:14:16] <Diadlo> i.e. it's not the reason of issue. But reason why I can't reproduse
[07:14:20] <zetok> in any case, https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3971 works now
[07:14:27] <zetok> Diadlo: mm :)
[07:14:56] <Diadlo> What version of toxcore are you use now?
[07:15:28] <zetok> 0.1
[07:15:50] <Diadlo> Lol
[07:16:12] <Diadlo> What we should do?
[07:16:51] <zetok> >bool local_discovery_enabled;
[07:16:55] <zetok> check it?
[07:17:04] <Diadlo> If you can
[07:17:14] <zetok> >void tox_options_set_local_discovery_enabled(struct Tox_Options *options, bool local_discovery_enabled);
[07:17:18] <zetok> err
[07:17:22] <zetok> that is set by the client
[07:17:41] <zetok> also, it should default to `enabled`, right?
[07:17:56] <zetok> >options->local_discovery_enabled = true;
[07:17:57] <zetok> yep
[07:18:14] <zetok> Diadlo: unless you change that to `false`, it's enabled
[07:18:29] <zetok> Diadlo: with that in mind, even if it's enabled clients can use TCP
[07:19:32] <zetok> Diadlo: you could restart either client
[07:19:43] <zetok> or perhaps `Reconnect`
[07:20:41] <Diadlo> For what?
[07:22:05] <zetok> to make an UDP connection
[07:22:18] <zetok> technically, toxcore is supposed to make one by itself
[07:22:38] <zetok> this might, or might not work automagically though
[07:23:59] <Diadlo> So you can reproduce or not?
[07:25:03] <zetok> yep
[07:26:01] <Diadlo> Ok. I will try it later
[07:40:00] <Diadlo> zetok: later it's ~tuesday
[07:40:28] <zetok> ok
[07:40:39] <zetok> so qTox 1.7 is going to stay on 0.0
[07:41:19] <Diadlo> :/
[07:41:38] <Diadlo> Next week -- week of testing?
[07:41:43] <zetok> yep
[07:43:08] <Diadlo> Seems, we have too small release circle
[07:43:21] <zetok> cycle ?
[07:43:28] <Diadlo> Yep
[07:43:41] <zetok> well
[07:43:49] <zetok> there are 5 weeks to get things merged
[07:43:54] <Diadlo> Yes
[07:44:18] <zetok> what is missing, is a clear calendar
[07:46:40] <zetok> actually
[07:46:46] <zetok> it could be redone
[07:46:51] <Diadlo> `glog -n90 | grep "feat" | grep "l10n" -v | wc -l` -> 11
[07:46:52] <Diadlo> :/
[07:47:56] <zetok> we could extend merge window to the 7 weeks, while still having testing week
[07:48:02] <Diadlo> The main features are accessibility and copy link
[07:48:20] <Diadlo> IDK
[07:48:21] <zetok> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[07:48:35] <Diadlo> Sometimes we have a lot of changes
[07:50:57] <Diadlo> You could ask other people
[07:51:22] <Diadlo> But I think, we should increase release cycle
[07:51:29] <zetok> :/
[07:51:34] <Diadlo> Maybe 7:1, maybe 6:2
[07:51:45] <zetok> I meant keeping 5:1
[07:52:10] <zetok> but having 6/7 weeks of merges in there
[07:52:18] <Diadlo> Yes. I understand what you meant
[07:53:24] <Diadlo> What about release patch?
[07:53:33] <Diadlo> 1.6.1
[07:53:37] <zetok> um?
[07:54:11] <Diadlo> 5 weeks + 1 week == new patch version
[07:54:53] <zetok> err
[07:55:25] <zetok> version number that is being bumped depends on what the release contains
[07:55:42] <zetok> if there's something more in the release than fixes, that's not a patch version
[07:58:16] <zetok> what do you think about having an rc0 after 5 weeks, and if there are no problems a release based on the rc0 + backported translations
[07:58:29] <zetok> this won't be that good :s
[07:58:51] <zetok> Diadlo: it's kinda better when there are more releases more quickly
[07:59:25] <zetok> Diadlo: the problem is the non-merge window, right?
[07:59:38] <zetok> s/quickly/often/
[08:00:33] <Diadlo> rc0 seems good
[08:01:03] <Diadlo> Why it's not good?
[08:01:59] <Diadlo> Nevermind. Let's leave current cycle
[08:03:27] <Diadlo> Also, what you think about revert changes in testing week if they are produce known issues?
[08:04:00] <Diadlo> If they are not fixed
[08:05:12] <zetok> yeah
[08:05:38] <zetok> depends on how bad something is
[08:05:53] <zetok> and what the change actually does
[08:05:54] <Diadlo> Off course
[08:07:53] <Diadlo> I have to go. Goodbye

[09:31:19] <zetok> that worked, thanks
[09:31:45] <sudden6> aren't these servers supposed to sync the keys?
[09:32:23] <zetok> supposed is the right word
[09:35:16] <zetok> sudden6: btw, TokTok migration probably won't happen in time for 1.7
[09:35:23] <zetok> unless you have some time?
[09:35:31] <sudden6> :(
[09:35:38] <zetok> I see.
[09:35:39] <sudden6> I'll see what I can do
[09:35:47] <sudden6> what's missing?
[09:35:51] <zetok> sudden6: the problem is with the regression
[09:36:09] <zetok> sudden6: https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3736#issuecomment-267665213

[09:37:51] <zetok> but Diadlo couldn't
[09:38:38] <sudden6> zetok: If you have the time left, you could try using the debugger
[09:39:22] <zetok> uh
[09:39:32] <zetok> I cannot really into debugger

[10:45:32] <oiyaer> that's not a problem
[10:45:38] <oiyaer> (at least not for me)
[10:45:49] <zetok> well, it's doable to make it not require restart
[10:46:39] <oiyaer> still better than seeing what I typed only after sending the message :)
[10:46:41] <zetok> I'll look into resizing without restart later
[10:47:13] <zetok> oh wait
[10:47:22] <zetok> :D
[10:47:28] <zetok> it does work without restart

[11:20:46] <oiyaer> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3452
[11:21:04] <oiyaer> could that make it to the next release too?

[11:29:57] <zetok> hmm
[11:31:36] <zetok> weird, I thought that qTox does have at least some of the flags enabled
[11:32:22] <oiyaer> that's the thing, qTox does not have the flags enabled
[11:32:31] <oiyaer> also enforcing DEP
