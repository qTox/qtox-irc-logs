[16:45:59] <zetok> sudd3n6: tumbleweed is broken :|
[16:46:12] <sudden6> in what sense?
[16:46:23] <zetok> >launch le program in terminal
[16:46:32] <zetok> >it's killed along with the terminal
[16:46:46] <sudden6> lol, good I didn't update yet^^
[16:46:55] <zetok> frankly, I gotta admit, it lasted longer than I expected
[16:47:50] <sudden6> hmm, I see nothing on reddit about an issue, I think it's not a common problem
[16:47:59] <sudden6> did you do anything you shouldn't do?
[16:48:33] <zetok> I use software.
[16:49:10] <zetok> maybe
[16:49:23] <sudden6> not using funky repos?
[16:49:28] <zetok> I mean, I just use software for what it was intended to do
[16:49:32] <zetok> just the qTox one
[16:50:36] <sudden6> you can always try to fix it by doing a zypper dup and a reboot afterwards
[16:51:01] <zetok> hmm
[16:51:47] <zetok> "try turning it off and on again" ?
[16:52:11] <sudden6> nope, getting the latest and greates and then turning it off and on again ;)
[16:52:20] <sudden6> *greatest
[16:52:32] <zetok> you mean broken
[16:53:49] <sudden6> try and tell me if it's still broken
[17:39:09] <zetok> gopull is almost ready

[17:43:46] <zetok> ok, actually it's ready
[17:44:00] <zetok> but I feel like there's still too much in main, so I'll refactor
