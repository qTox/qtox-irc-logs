[13:09:17] <zetok> sudden6: https://zetok.github.io/tox-spec/ ← how user manual could look like
[13:10:13] <sudden6> I'm not exactly sure if this is what a user manual should look like
[13:11:46] <zetok> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[13:11:54] <zetok> feel free to tinker with CSS
[13:12:03] <sudden6> I don't mean the CSS
[13:12:23] <zetok> oh
[13:12:37] <sudden6> a user manual should be user friendly and not just a wall of text, more pictures, less text
[13:12:53] <zetok> there's no problem with that though?
[13:14:32] <sudden6> ideally it would also contain some SEO, so if people start to google "qTox dark theme" they are directly at our user manual
[13:16:25] <zetok> fix that with sed
[13:16:56] <zetok> or perhaps rustdoc has something for including stuff
[13:17:58] <zetok> >--html-in-header
[13:18:01] <zetok> that should do
[13:18:55] <zetok> sudden6: so, there's no problem, right?
[13:18:56] <zetok> :D
[13:19:30] <sudden6> what do you mean with problem?
[13:19:45] <zetok> dunno
[13:20:03] <zetok> ><sudden6> I'm not exactly sure if this is what a user manual should look like
[13:20:23] <sudden6> ah, this was just a loud thought about what could be improved
[13:21:38] <zetok> mm
[13:21:59] <zetok> I'm not sure either, since markdown version looks a bit less appealing
[13:22:27] <zetok> https://github.com/zetok/tox-spec/blob/master/spec.md
[13:24:25] <zetok> https://zetok.github.io/tox-spec/#tox-id ← now with images :D
[13:25:19] <sudden6> *thumbsup*
