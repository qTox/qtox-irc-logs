[00:50:28] <VVD> sudden6, how to get it? git clone https://github.com/qTox/???? ?
[00:50:36] <x_> hello, i've posted in https://redd.it/5k9eg6 some feedback about the latest release
[00:50:39] <x_> if i should add my comment somewhere else pls let me know
[00:51:13] <sudden6> VVD: git clone https://github.com/qTox/qTox
[00:52:14] <sudden6> VVD: https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/INSTALL.md contains all instructions/dependencies for Linux, should be similar for you
[00:53:26] <sudden6> x_:  you shouldn't be even able to make it with qt4-qmake
[00:53:40] <x_> yet it requires qt4 specifically
[00:54:07] <x_> "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt4/bin/qmake"
[00:54:15] <x_> not sure why but hey
[00:54:24] <sudden6> do you have qmake-qt5?
[00:54:36] <x_> yes
[00:54:48] <sudden6> try using that :)
[00:56:45] <x_> http://imgur.com/a/vHZNz
[00:56:51] <x_> tried using it
[00:56:57] <x_> won't work
[00:57:13] <sudden6> what's the error?
[00:57:14] <x_> the qTox script still asks for qt4
[00:57:24] <sudden6> which script?
[00:58:41] <VVD> In file included from src/platform/camera/v4l2.cpp:23:

[01:00:59] <sudden6> ie calling the qt5 version explicitely
[01:01:28] <x_> only got a manpage result

[01:01:53] <VVD> :-D
[01:01:59] <sudden6> have you tried installing qtbase5-dev and then the dependencies
[01:02:10] <x_> yes, via aptitude
[01:02:30] <x_> apt-get install gave problems, aptitude seemed to install all the dependencies required
[01:02:47] <sudden6> VVD: you have to be inside the qTox source dir for it to work
[01:03:07] <VVD> it's about no bash in /bin
[01:03:27] <sudden6> oh, maybe you can rewrite the script then^^
[01:03:31] <VVD> ye
[01:03:32] <VVD> already
[01:03:37] <sudden6> or do the actions manually :)
[01:03:43] <VVD> I have bash in /usr/local/bin/bash

[01:07:32] <VVD> is toxcore too old?
[01:07:37] <sudden6> VVD: we switched to https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore
[01:08:25] <VVD> oh
[01:11:25] <x_> sudden6: the only result from running whereis qmake-qt5 is this line: qmake-qt5: /usr/share/man/man1/qmake-qt5.1.gz
[01:11:43] <sudden6> x_: that's very strange
[01:11:59] <sudden6> I'm updating my debian vm currently to investigate
[01:12:22] <VVD> sudden6, is this file correct to build toxcore: irungentoo-toxcore-0.160924-161ab46_GH0.tar.gz ?
[01:12:43] <sudden6> VVD: no, you need the one from the link I gave you
[01:12:56] <VVD> https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/blob/master/INSTALL.md
[01:13:06] <VVD> On FreeBSD 10+:
[01:13:06] <VVD> pkg install net-im/tox
[01:13:17] <VVD> net-im/tox have this one :-(
[01:13:21] <sudden6> you probably have to build it from source
[01:13:23] <VVD> outdated documentation
[01:13:28] <sudden6> yeah
[01:14:06] <sudden6> you could make a PR fixing that, iphy will be very happy to have someone try toxcore on FreeBSD^^
[01:18:50] <VVD> builded fine
[01:19:42] <VVD> but I don't know how to say qTox to search includes and libraries in custom place instead default /usr/local/include /usr/local/lib
[01:20:20] <sudden6> can't you just install c-toxcore into /usr/local/?
[01:20:28] <VVD> oh no
[01:21:06] <VVD> don't want hell in /usr/local
[01:21:22] <VVD> all files in /usr/local was installed from ports
[01:21:27] <sudden6> oh
[01:21:46] <VVD> all have checksum and etc
[01:23:00] <sudden6> use qmake INCLUDEPATH += "path"
[01:23:05] <sudden6> for the includes
[01:23:30] <sudden6> VVD: and LIBS += "path" for the libraries
[01:24:02] <VVD> in makefile?
[01:24:13] <sudden6> no just call qmake with these options
[01:24:25] <VVD> and for includes?
[01:24:48] <sudden6> INCLUDEPATH and LIBS should be all you need
[01:24:56] <sudden6> see https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qmake-variable-reference.html#includepath
[01:25:01] <sudden6> and a little bit below
[01:28:45] *** Joins: kchz (~dschulz@ )
[01:34:36] <x_> right, i think i passed the qmake step via installing libswscale-dev package and running /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/bin/qmake in the qTox dir, but now the make command is erroring out because of a missed dependency
[01:35:00] <sudden6> x_: which missing dependency?
[01:35:06] <x_> someone should add qtbase5-dev-tools
[01:35:33] <x_> make needs /qt5/bin/uic
[01:35:51] <sudden6> x_: mind making a PR with the needed adjustments to the install procedure?
[01:36:29] <x_> sure, i'll be documenting the process as i go along.
[01:36:46] <sudden6> perfect
[01:36:51] <VVD> sudden6, warning: src/video/camerasource.cpp:295:42: warning: 'codec' is deprecated [-Wdeprecated-declarations]
[01:37:13] <sudden6> VVD: you can ignore that
[01:37:17] <VVD> ye
[01:37:21] <VVD> I know
[01:37:25] <VVD> just inform u
[01:37:34] <VVD> ffmpeg-3.2.2_2,1
[01:37:56] <sudden6> yeah, we know that, but due to the wide range of ffmpeg we have to support, nobody bothered to update the code^^
[01:38:08] <VVD> np
[01:50:02] <sudden6> x_: for the dependencies simple_make.sh works without issues for Debian 8
[01:50:20] <sudden6> it only has problems checking out the correct c-toxcore tag
[01:50:24] <x_> right, i think i might have found the snag
[01:50:57] <x_> it has to do with the mesa package
[01:51:06] <x_> just a moment, i'll post details
[01:52:26] <x_> http://pastebin.com/fBre3Mr9
[01:52:29] <VVD> sudden6, /usr/local/lib/qt5/bin/qmake LIBS+=-L../c-toxcore INCLUDEPATH+=.
[01:52:34] <VVD> gmake
[01:53:18] <VVD> + move includes from /usr/local/include/tox + move libs from /usr/local/lib/libtox*
[01:53:42] <VVD> then: LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../c-toxcore ./qtox
[01:53:56] <VVD> and I got same ???? in file names
[01:54:02] <VVD> as with 1.6.0
[01:54:04] <VVD> :-(
[01:56:50] <sudden6> VVD: but building on FreeBSD works?
[01:56:57] <VVD> yes
[01:57:19] <VVD> audio, video, files and messages not tested :-D
[01:57:30] <VVD> just build and run
[01:57:55] <sudden6> If you could add this to https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/4013 I'd be pretty happy :)
[01:58:21] <sudden6> x_: I suppose you're using some additional repos?

[02:03:12] <x_> hey
[02:03:30] <x_> i'm back
[02:04:07] <x_> i was using backports for bbswitch, for my optimus laptop
[02:04:27] <x_> so mesa was updated to backports latest version
[02:04:58] <x_> yet the version required by qt5 and qTox is the stable version
[02:05:16] <x_> this is why the dependency conflict popped up
[02:05:33] <koshii> Is there a command-line parameter I can run to export my private keys from qtox?

[02:12:52] <sudden6> koshii: click on your avatar, scroll down and click "Export"
[02:18:32] <koshii> sudden6: Yes, but -- from the command line? :)
[02:29:19] <x_> right, after repairing the dependency mishaps (reverted mesa to the req'd stable version), i've cleaned the directory and made a fresh clone of the qTox repo, yet i'm still getting errors. this time it's compiling errors, and this is where my troubleshooting skills run out this time: http://pastebin.com/fpD9aAmG
[02:29:43] <x_> good night folks
[02:32:37] <zetok> koshii: nope
[02:33:43] <zetok> x_: could you paste that in gist?
[02:34:11] <zetok> VVD: could you do a git bisect?
[02:35:05] <zetok> VVD: `git bisect good v1.5.1 ; git bisect bad f5011cdb2feb2da042e373b4e4094e967bde8120`
[02:35:31] <zetok> VVD: that will compile with the toxcore from ports, and should be the range that contains the regression

[05:53:54] <Diadl0> zetok: I.e. did you fix your problem https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3913#issuecomment-267857698 ?
[05:54:24] <zetok> Diadl0: the problem isn't on my end
[05:54:39] <Diadl0> Do you build toxcore with cmake?
[05:54:48] <zetok> why would I?
[05:55:13] <Diadl0> Because it's required to build qtox with cmake
[05:55:24] <Diadl0> => for tests
[05:55:41] <zetok> it's a regression
[05:55:47] <Diadl0> Nope
[05:55:54] <zetok> qmake works just fine
[05:55:55] <Diadl0> I didn't remove old build system
[05:55:56] <zetok> cmake doesn't
[05:56:14] <Diadl0> Ok. I can change docs
[05:57:05] <Diadl0> Add `qtox cmake require to build toxcore with cmake`
[05:58:59] <Diadl0> It's not regression because we add new build system with new requirements
[05:59:53] <Diadl0> Why we add feature with dependency it's not regression?
[06:17:27] <Diadl0> zetok: ^
[06:18:03] <zetok> :/
[06:19:44] <zetok> question is, do we need that dependency?
[06:20:10] <zetok> i.e. why would cmake require other things to be build with cmake?
[06:20:11] <Diadl0> Now it's optional dependency
[06:20:20] <zetok> no, it's not an optional dep
[06:20:23] <Diadl0> I write it in comment
[06:20:35] <Diadl0> You still can build qTox with qmake
[06:20:45] <Diadl0> So, why it's not optional?
[06:21:12] <zetok> the moment qmake support is removed it would become a hard dependency
[06:21:25] <Diadl0> Yes. But not now
[06:21:38] * zetok shrugs
[06:21:46] <zetok> just FYI, this is going to cause problems
[06:21:55] <Diadl0> When we will remove qmake, maybe toxcore will be support only cmake build
[06:22:23] <Diadl0> They want to remove autogen, aren't they?
[06:22:45] <zetok> at some point
[06:22:56] <Diadl0> So, what the problem?
[06:23:23] <Diadl0> We can remove qmake after autogen removing
[06:23:32] <Diadl0> i.e. qmake build system
[06:23:48] <zetok> ><zetok> just FYI, this is going to cause problems
[06:24:25] <Diadl0> Removing qmake of autogen?
[06:24:46] <zetok> adding a "dependency" on cmake toxcore
[06:26:43] <Diadl0> Ok. Either cmake dependency for qtox with few fixes/features or not dependence and no fixes/features?
[06:26:58] <Diadl0> If the second one, I will close my PR
[06:27:21] <zetok> um, I'm just informing that this will result in problems
[06:28:09] <zetok> there are benefits, but there are also downsides that one should be aware of
[06:28:39] <Diadl0> What downsides?
[06:29:20] <Diadl0> Other than a new addiction
[06:29:26] <Diadl0> dependecy
[06:29:41] <zetok> from what I heard harder to build for android
[06:29:49] <zetok> and the new "dependency" will cause problems
[06:30:03] <Diadl0> So, it's toktok team scope. Right?
[06:30:05] <zetok> because toxcore "supports" both build system
[06:30:12] <zetok> yes
[06:30:16] <Diadl0> We can support both too
[06:30:24] <zetok> with cmake ?
[06:30:35] <Diadl0> qmake and cmake, yes
[06:30:51] <zetok> i.e. qTox cmake + toxcore autotools?
[06:31:13] * zetok sighs
[06:31:23] <Diadl0> Not
[06:31:29] <zetok> this should be fixed in toxcore's autotools build system
[06:31:37] <Diadl0> qTox cmake + toxcore cmake / qTox qmake + toxcore autotools
[06:31:43] <Diadl0> Ok
[06:31:48] <Diadl0> iphy: ^
[06:31:58] <Diadl0> Is it possible?
[06:32:25] <zetok> once that happens, there should be added note in the INSTALL.md that for toxcore's autotools only >=0.1.x versions are supported
[06:33:01] <zetok> still will result in problem for people who would try to compile qTox against autotools toxcore <0.1.x
[06:33:24] <zetok> but there probably could be added some ifdefs for that?
[06:33:41] <Diadl0> We already didn't support toxcore <0.1.0
[06:33:50] <zetok> so?
[06:34:33] <zetok> 0.1.{0,1,2} autotools also wouldn't be supported with qTox's cmake
[06:34:42] <Diadl0> Ok
[06:39:17] <Diadl0> FYI: It's strange if someone want to build qTox with cmake, but toxcore without it
[06:39:20] <Diadl0> zetok: ^
[06:39:33] <zetok> no, it's not
[06:39:43] <Diadl0> Usecase?
[06:39:49] <zetok> toxcore has close to ~no docs for building with cmake
[06:40:01] <Diadl0> Hm...
[06:40:14] <Diadl0> cmake <path> && make
[06:40:19] <zetok> + given that autotools are still supported, there's no reason to try and use cmake
[06:40:31] <zetok> Diadl0: yeah, that's close to nothing
[06:41:12] <zetok> btw, docs for cmake are required to remove qmake support in qTox
[06:41:50] <Diadl0> Why?
[06:41:56] <zetok> ?
[06:42:05] <zetok> docs are simply a requirement
[06:42:47] <zetok> i.e. without the docs, software is close to being useless
[06:43:03] <Diadl0> Can I just add undocumented CMake support?
[06:43:09] <Diadl0> Yes
[06:43:13] <zetok> sure
[06:43:14] <Diadl0> It will useful for me :)
[06:43:32] <Diadl0> Also, for travis in the future
[06:43:36] <Diadl0> For tests
[06:43:41] <zetok> but as long as there will be no docs for cmake only qmake build will be supported
[06:44:12] <Diadl0> Yes
[06:44:17] <zetok> I don't see much point in keeping qmake if cmake is added, but.. :/
[06:45:32] <Diadl0> Cmake support requires docs. If we have cmake support => there no reason to keep qmake. No reason for qmake => change travis config
[06:45:43] <Diadl0> IMO To many changes for one PR
[06:46:13] <Diadl0> I plan to do it in a few
[06:46:40] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] zetok pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vMfbU
[06:46:40] -qtox-git-spam- qTox/master 4bcf57b Zetok Zalbavar: style: adjust function arg names in header to changes in core.cpp
[06:46:48] <Diadl0> So, can you just test CMake?
[06:46:51] <Diadl0> zetok: ^
[06:46:53] <zetok> no
[06:46:56] <Diadl0> Thanks
[06:47:06] <zetok> I don't have toxcore build with cmake
[06:47:16] <Diadl0> But you can build it with cmake
[06:47:23] <zetok> too bothersome
[06:48:31] <Diadl0> It's very useful decision to qTox
[06:48:39] <Diadl0> *"useful"
[06:48:47] <zetok> `emerge net-libs/tox` ← if more than that is required to get toxcore, it's too bothersome for me
[06:49:35] <Diadl0> See above
[06:49:49] <Diadl0> I should go away. Bye

[10:21:29] <sudden6> <zetok> i.e. when you have identical archives, how could they have different contents? <- by using a different compression setting
[10:21:39] <sudden6> same content but the binary is different
[10:21:46] <zetok> then just use same setting :)
[10:22:07] <zetok> or just loop over the files
[10:22:07] <sudden6> we don't know which settings github uses
[10:22:22] <sudden6> that's what I wanted from the beginning
[10:22:43] <sudden6> but I can't get shasum to compute a hash over a directory
[10:28:03] <zetok> hm.
[10:28:14] <zetok> why would you do that?
[10:28:57] <zetok> actually, there are 2 ways
[10:29:20] <zetok> one is to iterate over files, the other one to just unpack & pack again
[10:29:39] <zetok> ><sudden6> we don't know which settings github uses
[10:29:42] <zetok> then just check it
[10:29:52] <zetok> again, you can make a loop with it
[10:32:17] <sudden6> I used diff
[10:32:52] <sudden6> comparing the archives is wrong
[10:33:03] <sudden6> we want to compare the content
[10:42:55] <zetok> if you can compare the archives, comparing contents is wrong

[12:37:47] <zetok> after ~24h of an "audio call" qTox uses 1.6 GB ram

[12:47:06] <Emcy> lol
[12:47:58] <Emcy> zetoks tag disappeared and a release under sudden 6 appeared
[12:51:07] <sudden6> Emcy: that's just how GH displays things

[13:09:27] <Emcy> utox stopped building after switching to toktok also
[13:13:06] <sudden6> Emcy: this is not #utox
[13:17:31] <zetok> no, but it's interesting
[13:17:50] <zetok> for both qTox and µTox to start failing to build for windows with c-toxcore

[21:31:44] <VVD> np
[21:31:52] <VVD> building…
[21:32:36] <sudden6> VVD: I checked the problem with russian letters in the profile name, but it works here without issues
[21:33:03] <sudden6> maybe you have qt without unicode support?
[21:33:23] <VVD> how to check?
[21:33:31] <sudden6> I have no idea
[21:33:44] <sudden6> do other qt applications have problems with russian letters?
[21:34:05] <VVD> qt5…
[21:36:00] <VVD> vlc with qt5 work with russian letters in files
[21:36:08] <sudden6> stupid question, does the filesystem you're trying to save to support unicode?
[21:36:29] <VVD> ofc
[21:36:43] <VVD> it work in qTox 1.5
[21:36:50] <sudden6> oh right
[21:36:54] *** Quits: Yoshimo (~anything@ ) (Quit: Yoshimo)
[21:37:15] <VVD> btw, Import dialog show ???? instead russian letters
[21:37:21] <VVD> in qTox 1.6
[21:38:45] <sudden6> hmm, also that works here
[21:39:07] <sudden6> does importing work even if it shows ?????
[21:43:11] <VVD> wireshark-qt5 in open file dialog show correct letters
[21:44:32] <VVD> mkvtoolnix-gui work too
[21:44:56] <sudden6> have you tried compiling qTox 1.5.1 yourself and see if it works?
[21:45:23] <VVD> It work before upgrade to 1.5
[21:45:25] <VVD> It work before upgrade to 1.7
[21:45:27] <VVD> It work before upgrade to 1.6
[21:45:28] <VVD> :-D
[21:46:07] <sudden6> yeah, but maybe there's a difference between you building 1.5 and the packager building 1.5
[21:46:32] <sudden6> some optional dependency, compiler switch, idk could be anything
[21:47:50] <VVD> Import don't work too
[21:48:02] <VVD> qTox 1.6, file with russian letters

[21:51:06] <sudden6> I'm out of ideas of how to solve this...
[21:51:35] <sudden6> you can always try to git bisect it though
[21:51:40] <VVD> tested last 1.7 - same
[21:51:54] <VVD> how to get 1.5?
[21:52:17] <sudden6> git checkout v1.5.1
[21:52:36] <VVD> oh, and need FreeBSD patches…
[21:53:26] <sudden6> they should be in here https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/net-im/qTox/files/
[21:54:14] <sudden6> just apply them manually after checkout
[22:02:12] <VVD> I got old version of port
[22:02:16] <VVD> with 1.5.2
[22:07:12] <VVD> sudden6, just compiled and run 1.5.2 - I see russian letters in Import dialog and in pick profile dialog too
[22:07:16] <VVD> all work fine
[22:07:55] <sudden6> then you'll have to use git bisect between 1.5.2 and 1.6.0(this is the first broken, right?)
