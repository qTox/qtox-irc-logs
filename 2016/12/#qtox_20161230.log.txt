[05:57:45] <zetok> git checkout v1.7.0 -b for-1.7.1 && git cherry-pick e7276e7b43dd7b8631074866c27dfd70e40ae9f5 8d320ca3be01cdbb137c827df071ce4eebe44e4c 56d656502c82d81e5339fad7eb7bc77545adea8b && git tag -s v1.7.1

[06:03:34] <Diadlo> zetok: Done
[06:05:08] <Diadlo> It's all?
[06:06:37] <zetok> ~yep
[06:06:46] <Diadlo> Ok. Thanks
[06:07:13] <zetok> perhaps we should ping yurivict to package it for FreeBSD

[06:08:49] * zetok wonders why there is no way to comment on tag

[06:19:21] <zetok> actually, I was wondering whether to not push the branch on every commit
[06:19:44] <zetok> what do you think?
[06:20:05] <Diadlo> If you will, it make nightly builds? Or what?
[06:20:22] <zetok> it would push latest tag
[06:20:42] <Diadlo> Every time push one tag? Right>
[06:20:43] <Diadlo> ?
[06:20:48] <zetok> ~yep
[06:21:04] <Diadlo> For what?
[06:21:16] <zetok> to ensure that it actually works :s
[06:21:45] <zetok> e.g. for osx build scripts I've made a test that checks whether a .dmg binary has been produced
[06:22:06] <zetok> and check runs every time osx build is ran
[06:22:16] <zetok> pushing branch has no checks
[06:22:55] <zetok> and it only runs when tag is pushed, which doesn't happen often
[06:23:01] <Diadlo> If I understand correct, you can modify it in the PR, aren't you?
[06:23:14] <zetok> um?
[06:23:22] <zetok> modify what?
[06:23:44] <Diadlo> .travis script
[06:24:02] <zetok> yeah?
[06:24:29] *** Joins: MDrights (~MDrights@ )
[06:25:13] <Diadlo> I don't see the real reason to push the same tag on every commit. But you can do this changes in PR, which you want to test
[06:25:24] <zetok> um, no
[06:26:22] <zetok> while .travis stuff can be modified in a PR, all the stuff that requires oauth tokens won't work, since secret travis vars aren't available in PRs
[06:27:17] <zetok> the workaround is to push to a branch under qTox/
[06:30:03] <Diadlo> Ok. If you need it to tests -> just do it

[08:30:04] <LittleVulpix> So a friend of mine wants to try using tox (after watching the snowden documentary :P) and I can't recommend qtox because for the past X days the latest version released is not available for windows, and I don't want to discourage him by making him update manually after it's all fixed and then having to explain why :p c'mon guys, why you do dis.
[08:32:16] * zetok doesn't
[08:33:36] <zetok> i.e. I don't even have access to any of the windows building stuff ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[08:35:27] <LittleVulpix> zetok: what does that even mean
[08:36:34] <zetok> jenkins → signing → update server
[08:37:13] <zetok> access to those is fairly limited
[08:37:57] <zetok> aside from jenkins, last 2 steps require tux3 to do things
[08:38:02] <zetok> and he's MIA again
[08:38:24] <zetok> as for jenkins, none of qTox devs aside from tux3 have access to it
[08:38:35] <zetok> (look above)
[08:41:31] <sudden6> zetok: btw, did anybody shoot him an email about releasing qTox for Windows?
[08:41:42] <sudden6> maybe that could speed up things
[08:42:09] <zetok> sudden6: I told him that release was going to be on 25th when he was online, and nurupo shot him an email about windows build failing on jenkins
[08:42:38] <sudden6> also, we should start to include our signatures into qTox so this won't happen again
[08:42:44] <sudden6> hm, ok
[08:43:13] <zetok> right
[08:43:21] <zetok> where to include pubkeys?
[08:43:51] <sudden6> somewhere in the updater IIRc
[08:45:04] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/updater/update.cpp#L30,L34
[08:45:12] <sudden6> yep, also found it
[08:58:44] <zetok> what do you think about replacing the C++ code used for signing/stuff with Rust?
[08:58:58] <sudden6> not much atm
[08:59:26] <zetok> I'll take that as a "yes"
[09:08:25] <zetok> btw, how's rust-identicon is going?
[09:37:53] <sudden6> zetok: you'd have to write an ui with Rust
[09:38:03] <zetok> nope
[09:38:47] <zetok> time is not ripe for it yet
[09:38:50] <sudden6> then, have fun integrating Rust with qt
[09:39:12] <zetok> no need :3
[09:39:29] <sudden6> then how do you intend to do this?
[09:39:53] <sudden6> rust-identicon is on ice for now

[10:44:28] <zetok> sudden6: ↑
[10:44:42] <zetok> I'll replace other tools too after this
[10:46:31] <sudden6> Is this still RFC or am I supposed to critizise every minor thing I find?
[10:48:12] <iphy> zetok: does qTox now depend on rust?
[10:48:41] <zetok> sudden6: criticise all you want ;)
[10:48:43] <iphy> Or just a tool?
[10:48:48] <zetok> iphy: tooling
[10:49:19] <iphy> Ok cool
[10:50:45] <zetok> as for qTox itself, I'll look into that in the future
[10:51:33] <zetok> i.e. IMO it would be preferable to have first solid base to build on (zetox), and from there parts in the clients could be improved/replaced

[11:51:37] <zetok> VVD: why?
[11:52:23] <VVD> build one more monster only for building qtox
[11:53:29] <VVD> perl and python on every host are too much already

[11:54:00] <VVD> 2.7 and 3.5
[11:54:09] <zetok> yeah
[11:54:19] <zetok> and python still cannot into utf8
[11:54:19] <VVD> and tcl+tk too
[11:54:36] <VVD> and gcc + clang + llvm
[11:55:02] <VVD> lua
[11:55:09] <VVD> ruby
[11:55:10] <VVD> lol
[11:55:16] <VVD> it's all on my host
[11:55:26] <sudden6> VVD: are you developing in all these languages? :DD
[11:55:31] <VVD> but I don't use all that except gcc & clang
[11:56:07] <VVD> ofc no - just dependencies (build, install and run)
[11:56:42] <VVD> ocaml and vala
[11:57:05] <zetok> good thing that Rust is going to deprecate Vala :3
[11:57:12] <VVD> fuck this zoo of program languages and compillers
[11:57:27] <zetok> yeah
[11:57:36] <zetok> stuff just should be written in Rust
[11:58:08] <sudden6> https://xkcd.com/927/
[11:58:17] <VVD> vinagre-3.18.2_3 depends on telepathy-glib-0.24.1_1, that depends on vala-0.30.2 - I can't remove vala :-(
[11:58:31] <zetok> sudden6: except that this isn't the case
[11:58:50] <zetok> sudden6: i.e. one can compile rust to asmjs
[11:59:04] <sudden6> one can also compile c to asmjs
[11:59:07] <zetok> pff
[11:59:12] <sudden6> ;)
[11:59:27] <zetok> you've missed the point
[11:59:45] <sudden6> this asmjs thing is by far the most ridicoulus one^^
[11:59:58] <zetok> except that it's not :D
[12:00:57] <zetok> frankly, I'd enjoy compiling perfectly fine Rust code to asmjs and make browsers slow down as much as possible :D
[12:00:57] <sudden6> Rust/C -> Compiler -> Interpreter(Compiled C Code) -> Machine
[12:01:41] <sudden6> btw, how far has formally verifying the Rust language gone?
[12:01:44] <VVD> there are chances that in near feature u can't build Firefox without rust !!!!!!
[12:01:58] <sudden6> VVD: you probably already can't
[12:02:05] <VVD> I can
[12:02:08] <VVD> I did it
[12:02:09] <VVD> :-D
[12:02:15] <sudden6> some parser is already written in Rust IIRC
[12:02:19] <VVD> firefox-50.1.0_4,1
[12:02:34] <sudden6> maybe it's optional
[12:02:36] <VVD> but there is build option "RUST"
[12:03:25] <VVD> but for 51 or 52 - may be not optional dependency…
[12:04:08] <zetok> sudden6: I dunno about format verification
[12:04:51] <zetok> and I'm not sure if that's even doable, given the rate of changes
[12:06:30] <VVD> I have idea - rewrite qTox on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck :-D
[12:06:39] <zetok> not doable
[12:06:51] <sudden6> hmm, maybe there's a C++ to Brainfuck compiler :DD
[12:06:54] <zetok> nope
[12:07:04] <zetok> brainfuck doesn't support needed features
[12:07:23] * zetok has looked into transpiling code to brainfuck
[12:07:37] <sudden6> since when is sanity a needed feature for qTox? :DD
[12:07:45] <zetok> not sanity
[12:08:17] <VVD> there are no qt5 for Brainfuck bindings
[12:09:06] <sudden6> aww
[12:09:29] <sudden6> I always wanted to write some nice Qt GUI with Brainfuck
[12:09:30] <zetok> one would need to expand branfuck language for the features that CPUs gained in the last ~30 years or so
[12:09:38] <zetok> brainfuck*
[12:10:31] <sudden6> zetok: since it seems to be turing complete, it should theoretically be doable

[13:26:15] <terwt> oh
[13:26:54] <terwt> I am waiting for 1.7.0 so that I can deploy it on my friends' machines. The fixed autoupdater is extremely important in 1.7.0 - that's why I don't want to install 1.6.0 on their machines.
[13:26:55] <zetok> no idea when tux3 would have time to update things

[13:32:35] <terwt> tox is the only chat program that guarantees that the communication is encrypted - because it does not have an unencrypted mode of operation
[13:32:46] <Emcy_> all of your friends are neckbeards then
[13:33:31] <zetok> :D
[13:34:26] <terwt> yup :)
[13:36:57] <Emcy_> levity aside how can you make a 'release' without working bainaries, without even thinking about it until after the tag
[13:37:25] <Emcy_> for linux its barely acceptable, if youve given up on the yotld completely. For windows users its a joke
[13:39:03] <zetok> question is: what motivation is there to care?
[13:40:18] <Emcy_> work that question back to first principles: what motivation is there to even work on tox if you dont care if anyone actually uses it

[14:17:26] <sudden6> I'm not quite sure this is a good idea, because it makes the UI rather unflexible, on the other hand, is qTox going to support anything other than Tox soon?
[14:17:38] <zetok> no
[14:17:49] <sudden6> zetok: see https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/4027

[14:18:50] <zetok> `ToxPk`
[14:19:29] <zetok> or perhaps `ToxPubkey`

[14:19:49] <zetok> >I named it ToxKey because it could theoretically also hold an SK
[14:19:53] <zetok> that's a very bad idea
[14:19:59] <sudden6> I know ;)
[14:20:10] <zetok> um.
[14:20:31] <sudden6> I was working on the details as I went^^
[14:21:13] <sudden6> I'll rename it to ToxPk then :)
[14:21:20] <zetok> thanks
[14:22:45] <sudden6> so how do I rename it without having to redo everything?^^
[14:23:17] <zetok> split PR into multiple ones
[14:23:38] <zetok> then git rebase
[14:23:53] <sudden6> this rebase is bugging me, it'll have a lot of conflicts
[14:24:09] <sudden6> a lot > 50
[14:24:26] <zetok> yeah
[14:24:41] <zetok> would have been easier if PR was small to begin with :|
[14:26:02] <sudden6> the only big thing is #2 and that can't be split in smaller parts, without breaking compiliation
[14:28:44] <zetok> sudden6: btw, since you're going to edit things, could you sort(1) headers / sources ?
[14:29:44] <sudden6> I did where I changed them, but IMO this is out scope
[14:30:19] <zetok> err
[14:30:34] <zetok> no, keeping things sorted is not out of the scope
[14:30:42] <zetok> sudden6: I mean just the qtox.pro
[14:31:12] <sudden6> oh, yep will do

[19:59:40] <zetok> Diadlo: I was (still am) hoping that maintainers who aren't familiar with Rust yet could start getting familiar :)
[20:02:33] <Diadlo> I think, not me
[20:03:13] <zetok> um, why not?
[20:03:35] <Diadlo> I'm not interested
[20:03:58] <zetok> err
[20:04:42] <Diadlo> I'm better know, what i'm interested and what not. So not error
[20:05:29] <zetok> how can you know that you're not interested in something that you don't know? :)
[20:06:07] <Diadlo> Maybe word `interested` have a bit different meaning in english
[20:06:58] <Diadlo> I meant something like "I don't want"
[20:07:47] <zetok> yeah, you got that right
[20:09:17] <zetok> e.g. how can one know that they don't like something if they haven't tasted it?
[20:09:25] <Diadlo> Do I want to be able to play the domra? No
[20:09:42] <Diadlo> I just don't want it
[20:09:55] <zetok> >.<
[20:10:01] <Diadlo> Do you want?
[20:10:15] <Diadlo> Or, maybe, you already can?)
[20:11:07] <zetok> I don't see why I wouldn't want to be able to play it :)
[20:11:24] <zetok> play on it*
[20:12:21] <Diadlo> You're just trying to impose Rust
[20:13:18] <Diadlo> Ok
[20:13:27] <Diadlo> I have an argument
[20:13:31] <zetok> not just, and only slightly ;)
[20:13:49] <zetok> there are actual benefits
[20:13:50] <Diadlo> I have a lot of plans and I haven't time
[20:15:09] <zetok> :)

[20:20:15] <DaSpirit> Hello.
[20:24:16] <zetok> DaSpirit: I've been wondering; there's no chance of you helping with qTox in any near future, right?
[20:25:21] <DaSpirit> Likely not. I've been trying to get into game dev. I've done a lot of tinkering and I'm going to start making a serious indie game next.
[20:25:46] <zetok> I see
[20:25:50] <DaSpirit> And I've also been paying more attention to Matrix than Tox...
[20:25:56] <zetok> :(
[20:26:13] <zetok> you know that matrix is broken security-wise?
[20:26:36] <DaSpirit> lol how?
[20:26:44] <zetok> ?
[20:26:48] <zetok> how it's not?
[20:26:59] <zetok> it's has "security hole" written all over it
[20:27:16] <zetok> it was made to be pwn3d
[20:27:59] <zetok> granted, there are worse things out there
[20:28:05] <zetok> still.
[20:28:30] <DaSpirit> Yeah but last I seen a few months ago we still didn't have new group chats out yet.
[20:28:32] <Emcy_> really how isit borken
[20:28:33] <DaSpirit> Did that change yet?
[20:28:57] <zetok> c-toxcore 0.3 most likely will have new groupchats
[20:29:37] <Diadlo> DaSpirit: Hello. Also not toxcore has WIP persistent groupchat
[20:34:25] <Diadlo> *now
[20:37:30] <zetok> DaSpirit: ok then, there's no problem with removing you from qTox gh org, right?
[20:37:48] <DaSpirit> Yeah go ahead and remove it then.
[20:38:21] <zetok> ok, done
