[19:24:29] <zetok> (the best kind of tags)

[19:29:42] <zetok> yep
[19:32:37] <sudden6> updated :)
[19:32:54] <zetok> PR ?
[19:34:31] <sudden6> can I just use "create new file" from the GH web-ui?
[19:34:54] <sudden6> or do I have to fork the blog repo?
[19:34:57] <zetok> :s
[19:35:17] <zetok> feel free to use web UI, but that'll need to be merged
[19:35:40] <zetok> or maybe we shouldn't bother with GPG for the blog
[19:35:48] <zetok> like with the website

[19:55:45] <zetok> sudden6: rename to .md

[19:56:09] <sudden6> arg
[19:56:23] <zetok> also, there's inconsistency between the title and file name
[19:56:30] <zetok> (but that shouldn't matter)
[19:57:17] <sudden6> Is there a way to preview the final look?
[19:58:10] <zetok> `jekyll serve`
[19:58:27] <sudden6> ok, haven't checked out the bog repo
[20:00:34] <sudden6> did your way to show the current dev state work out?

[20:04:14] <sudden6> Thx, looks good to me :)
[20:06:33] <zetok> should we push, or wait for someone's else opinion?
[20:07:02] <sudden6> I'd like a second opinion, at least for the English
[20:07:17] <zetok> right
[20:07:22] <sudden6> besides that, the new release cycle isn't planned out
[20:07:25] <sudden6> yet
[20:11:04] <zetok> added some comments
[20:11:56] <sudden6> both seem valid to me
[20:12:18] <zetok> um
[20:12:33] <zetok> `checkout` is something that strikes me as a git command
[20:12:53] <zetok> check out ≠ checkout
[20:12:56] <zetok> (AFAIK)

[21:41:36] <Diadlo> I found only 1 place, where we check `findFriend` result without subsequent use
[21:45:51] <sudden6> I found 3
[21:46:06] <sudden6> ok 2
[21:46:29] <sudden6> maybe I overlooked more stuff than I thought on the first pass
[21:46:44] <sudden6> Diadlo: you can probably ignore this
[21:57:32] <Diadlo> sudden6: I found in `FriendListWidget::dragEnterEvent` where the second one?

[21:59:37] <Diadlo> Oh... I was searching only in my patches. Thanks :)
[22:00:51] <Diadlo> About `chatForm` in `Friend` class
[22:00:58] <Diadlo> I planned remove chatForm from Friend in next PR. But if you think, that better do it here -- I can.
[22:02:35] <sudden6> If you have it planned in the next PR just note it in the review, no need to blow up this PR even more.
