[10:27:16] <zetok> ~yep
[10:27:27] <Diadlo> Why `~`?
[10:28:32] <zetok> well, that's when `master` branch should get it
[10:29:12] <Diadlo> Should I create PR to new branch?
[10:29:26] <zetok> there probably should be a PR with the switch before 0.1, so that people could test
[10:29:37] <Diadlo> So close current PR?
[10:29:45] <zetok> Diadlo: um, I think that current PR is fine

[11:29:27] <Diadlo> No. It will be called only once

[14:11:18] <iphy> SkyzohKey: it needs tests
[14:11:57] <iphy> SkyzohKey: at the very least, it needs a Travis config so it's compiled on ci
[14:12:40] <iphy> SkyzohKey: I'm collecting bindings with tests so we have better coverage for toxcore changes, since toxcore tests themselves are rather poor
[14:13:01] <iphy> Especially around av
[14:13:54] <SkyzohKey> hmm
[14:14:11] <SkyzohKey> I dunno how to write tests for a vapi file, :x
[14:16:27] <iphy> Write a program that uses the vapi bindings to start two tox instances that send messages to each other
[14:16:38] <iphy> The test ends when the message arrives
[14:16:50] <iphy> Can you do that?
[14:16:52] <SkyzohKey> is this really reliable ?
[14:17:17] <iphy> Not totally, but it's the best we've got at the moment
[14:17:50] <SkyzohKey> hmm, i guess that's doable, but i've no time for that currently :/
[14:34:43] *** Joins: bashrc (~motters@ )
[14:37:59] <iphy> SkyzohKey: I'd like to collect the bindings so when we make API changes we can make sweeping changes to all bindings to keep them up to date

[14:38:17] <bashrc> is it possible to record voice calls? I'm thinking of interviews on podcasts
[14:38:29] <SkyzohKey> bashrc: not sure that it's a great idea

[15:02:43] <zetok> oh
[15:02:57] <zetok> right, video doesn't have HW acceleration

[15:51:37] <bashrc> one question is how to hang up a video call. Selecting the video button doesn't have any effect
[15:52:09] <iphy> SkyzohKey: it's really important
[15:52:25] <iphy> SkyzohKey: because we've changed the API, and I think this might be a problem for your current vapi files
