[15:52:17] <Diadl0> Hello everybody :)
[15:53:15] <zetok> hi
[15:57:08] <Diadl0> zetok: We need script to autoincrement copyright date :)
[15:57:51] <zetok> how it would be supposed to work?
[15:58:46] <Diadl0> Check last changed files in git and replace years
[15:59:17] <Diadl0> Or it should go through all files and check last modification date
[15:59:40] <zetok> hmm
[16:00:12] *** Quits: bashrc (~motters@ ) (Remote host closed the connection)
[16:01:31] <Diadl0> git diff --stat show files + statistics without changes
[16:02:12] <Diadl0> Can it be done in merge commit?
[16:02:37] <zetok> no
[16:02:55] *** Joins: bashrc (~motters@ )
[16:02:59] <Diadl0> Ok
[16:03:07] <Diadl0> Why?
[16:03:26] <zetok> merge commit doesn't change the code
[16:03:35] <zetok> if it did, it would need to pass checks
[16:03:40] <zetok> travis + review
[16:04:32] <Diadl0> Ok
[16:06:47] <zetok> grep -i copyright src/ | wc -l
[16:06:47] <zetok> 281
[16:06:59] <zetok> yeah, script could be useful
[16:09:30] <Diadl0> Not all files was changed in this year :)
[16:10:06] <zetok> no, but having a script that automate increasing number when needed will be useful
[16:11:44] <zetok> I'm not sure though if I would write it
[16:13:19] <zetok> src/core/cstring.cpp:    Copyright © 2014 by The qTox Project
[16:13:35] <zetok> ↑ e.g. that would be problematic, since range can't be really applied yet
[16:14:03] <zetok> so if it's changed, it would need `2014, 2016`, and then `2014, 2016-2017`
[16:14:51] <zetok> "fun"
[16:36:55] <iphy> why do you even want to increase the number?
[16:39:57] <iphy> zetok: is The qTox Project a legal entity?
[16:50:42] <Diadl0> zetok: I don't think, that replace on `2014-2016` instead of `2014, 2016` will be big problem
[16:52:20] <zetok> iphy: nope
[16:53:24] <zetok> 'The qTox Project' = 'The qTox Project Contributors'
[17:06:23] <iphy> Diadl0: why do you want to update the year?
[17:07:01] <zetok> updating copyright should happen once "significant changes" have been made

[19:05:12] <zetok> right
[19:08:59] <zetok> I don't know if it qualifies as such, but given that git{,hub} offers {tar,zip}balls for each of commits that are available, it would seem to be sort of a "release" when commits are pushed to repo
[19:09:27] <zetok> + there are qTox alpha "releases" based on master
[19:09:47] <zetok> I don't really know though, it just seems like the right thing to do
[19:10:34] <zetok> ><iphy> the gnu site doesn't say why you should be doing that
[19:11:02] <zetok> yeah, but it seems to be a common practice when it comes to copyright, e.g. with books

[21:11:05] <Diadl0> zetok: > Average amount of items that one can hold in their short-term memory is 7
[21:11:37] <Diadl0> I have one question: why a reader should hold header in memory?
[21:12:36] <zetok> short-term memory works more in a manner of FILO
[21:12:59] <zetok> and to process information, you need to hold it in memory
[21:13:03] <Diadl0> I see READEME.md like a short book
[21:13:17] <zetok> it's not really one
[21:13:22] <zetok> it's more of a website
[21:13:35] <Diadl0> This is the reason, why we use links in header
[21:14:41] <Diadl0> User should not remember header
[21:14:53] <zetok> err
[21:16:09] <Diadl0> On my monitor header take exactly one line. IMO, it's seems perfect
[21:16:48] <Diadl0> except IRC Channel info
[21:17:28] <zetok> ><Diadl0> User should not remember header
[21:17:55] <zetok> if user doesn't need to hold that info even in their short-term memory, we should remove header altogether, since it's unnecessary
[21:18:42] <zetok> Diadl0: and it's not perfect, given that no one looks at it
[21:18:49] <zetok> or rather, at its contents
[21:19:06] <Diadl0> I think, no one read whole README.md in first time. He/she just find useful information
[21:19:30] <zetok> yeah, and finding info should be as simple and straightforward as possible
[21:20:11] <zetok> more items in header make it less simple
[21:20:13] <Diadl0> Yes. Finding text in 1-2 lines it's too hard </sarcasm>
[21:20:23] <zetok> Yes.
[21:20:29] <Diadl0> "Err"
[21:20:42] <zetok> if you require users to do something that is completely unnecessary, you're doing it wrong
[21:21:02] <zetok> users shouldn't have to find info in 1-2 lines
[21:21:15] <zetok> things that they are looking for should be nicely exposed to them
[21:21:39] <Diadl0> If you remove some parts from header you require users read most part of README
[21:21:54] <Diadl0> To find needed information
[21:23:02] <zetok> except that people aren't reading, and what they are looking for is nicely exposed :)
[21:23:28] <zetok> `Help us` has a nice, big, bold font
[21:24:14] <zetok> right below downloads section, where people would look
[21:24:20] <Diadl0> I must admit
[21:24:31] <Diadl0> I never seen this part before
[21:25:14] <Diadl0> I thought, that all, what we have in README listed in header
[21:25:53] <zetok> >.<
[21:26:18] * zetok wonders if it's possible to have <blink> stuff in .md
[21:27:05] <zetok> ok
[21:27:06] <Diadl0> When I see header with links, I interpret it as an index. And if I didn't see needed part -- what reason to read it?
[21:27:50] <Diadl0> What you mean by `<blink> stuff`?
[21:28:05] <zetok> Diadl0: https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs
[21:28:15] <zetok> Diadl0: <blink> html tag :P
[21:29:00] <Diadl0> Like this? :D http://avos.me/
[21:29:22] <zetok> uuh
[21:29:34] <zetok> no, although that's something
[21:29:41] <zetok> blinking text
[21:29:54] <Diadl0> I understand. It was a joke :)
[21:30:41] <Diadl0> This is the best advertising I've ever seen)
[21:31:10] <zetok> a bit heavy on eyes
[21:31:26] <zetok> not the best kind of an advert that I've seen though
[21:32:05] <Diadl0> Hm.. I think, problem with no-js
[21:32:16] <Diadl0> It should redirect after few seconds
[21:33:54] <zetok> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zizoHJXo9Pw ← best advert
[21:34:08] <zetok> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nITLob098W8 ← not as good, but it gives you the taste ;)
[21:34:10] <Diadl0> `AVOS` it's wordplay. Translated ~like `off chance`
