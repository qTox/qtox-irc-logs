[12:22:36] <Neolex> sorry ^^
[12:23:35] <Neolex> I set "value" to 33545 in the design editor but it's 0 by default ..

[17:01:11] <sudden6> well I think the function is a good approach

[18:22:33] <Emcy_> why not? tox should become at least as good at holepunching as skype was
[18:22:45] <Emcy_> enterprise used to complain a lot that skype was difficult to block
[18:23:02] <Emcy_> even used to obfuscate as port 80 and 443

[18:24:02] <Emcy_> its the most basic form

[18:25:31] <Diadlo> Maybe I have wrong understanding of `package obfuscation`
[18:25:43] <Emcy_> they did a few things
[18:26:01] <Emcy_> changed from 6881 to randomised port each start for each client
[18:26:24] <Emcy_> implemented opportunistic payload encryption
[18:26:37] <Emcy_> eventually even phased out tcp pretty much completely
[18:27:07] <Emcy_> they got serious about it after the sandvine scandal you may have heard of it
[18:27:30] <Emcy_> intermediaries WILL try and fuck with protocols that harm their interests
[18:27:49] <zetok> …
[18:27:55] <zetok> Emcy_: pls
[18:28:00] <Emcy_> i think even skype was being blocked on the carrier level with some mobile providers a few years ago because they were shit scared of losing sms revenue and such
[18:28:33] <zetok> ><Emcy_> its the most basic form
[18:28:35] <zetok> it's not
[18:28:56] <zetok> Emcy_: also, you should read the spec
[18:29:25] <Emcy_> how is randomising the port not a light obfuscation
[18:30:55] <zetok> how it is?
[18:31:47] <Emcy_> because youd have to fingerprint the traffic somehow to find where tox is rather than just going to 33445
[18:32:54] <zetok> err
[18:33:09] <zetok> one should assume that traffic analysis is already happening
[18:33:33] *** Quits: cenysor (~cenysor@ ) (Quit: Leaving)
[18:33:57] <Emcy_> no doubt
[18:34:06] *** Joins: cenysor (~cenysor@ )
[18:34:08] <zetok> so "it would help if there was no traffic analysis going on" is not a valid argument
[18:34:42] <Emcy_> still makes it marginally more expensive to perform
[18:34:58] <zetok> :)
[18:35:25] <Emcy_> thats what tox is about. increasing the cost of surveillance
[18:36:05] <zetok> Emcy_: would you mind making an issue for it?
[18:36:28] <Emcy_> seems like something for toxcore it hink
[18:36:34] <zetok> nope
[18:36:42] <zetok> toxcore already provides what is needed
[18:36:50] <Emcy_> ok
[18:36:55] <Emcy_> youre right
[18:37:57] <zetok> option to randomize port range start on qTox start
[18:38:04] <zetok> (on by default)
[18:39:27] <Emcy_> what does tox use more than 1 port for
[18:39:42] <zetok> to Just Work™
[18:39:52] <Emcy_> eh
[18:40:17] <Emcy_> i hope it doesnt seperate signalling and data ports. every protocol that does that is a nightmare
[18:40:30] <zetok> err
[18:40:42] <zetok> Just Work™ is Just Works™
[18:41:01] <zetok> toxcore tries to bind to port, if it's already in use, it tries next one from range
[18:41:26] <Emcy_> i had some fucking shit last week where the nat of the hotspot i was using was too stupid to pipe thru the data port for my sip phone, so i had no sound on incoming calls. so annoying
[18:41:42] <Emcy_> ok right ok. thats fine
[18:42:06] <Emcy_> NAT fucks up everything as usual
[18:42:22] <zetok> investing in ipv6 is not an option?
[18:43:30] <Emcy_> i was out of town and it was rando hotel wifi
[18:43:43] <zetok> I see
[18:43:43] <Emcy_> at least it was free
[18:43:54] <Emcy_> if i was not a shlub id just get a vpn
[18:44:32] <Emcy_> ftp is a pain in the ass for the same reason
