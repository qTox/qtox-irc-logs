[10:06:41] <merNAZI> Hey, I did a test with udp
[10:06:48] *** merNAZI is now known as merdeepcore
[10:06:58] <merdeepcore> it crashes 6 out of 10 routers
[10:07:07] <merdeepcore> is this submitted somewhere ?
[10:42:18] <BoneZone> can we file it under bugs of the universe "routers are crap"
[10:46:01] <zetok> merdeepcore: specific router vendors, or generally?
[10:49:02] <BoneZone> a lot of crappy consumer routers try to track each udp session as a new tcp one and then run out of state table space
[10:49:05] <BoneZone> and fall over
[10:49:18] <zetok> um
[10:49:26] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/wiki/FAQ#why-is-qtox-killing-my-internet-connection
[10:49:52] <BoneZone> nice
[10:49:58] <BoneZone> you should name it hte BoneZone effect

[11:21:11] <merdeepcore> zetok: random routers
[11:21:15] <merdeepcore> one is tplink
[11:21:19] <merdeepcore> the other is netgear
[11:21:21] <merdeepcore> the other is ZTE
[11:21:31] <merdeepcore> the other is thomson
[11:21:35] <merdeepcore> the others Im not sure but I can check
[11:22:47] <zetok> right
[11:22:57] <zetok> what do you think about creating a wiki page with list of routers?
[11:23:04] <merdeepcore> isnt it a bit too much to call 60% of all routers crap
[11:23:05] <zetok> (or something)
[11:23:16] <merdeepcore> i know many programs that do udp connections perfectly
[11:23:19] <merdeepcore> why is qtox different ?
[11:23:21] <zetok> not really
[11:23:47] <zetok> rate
[11:24:17] <merdeepcore> why is tox different when it comes to rate to other udp consuming programs ?
[11:24:21] <zetok> merdeepcore: are those programs p2p?
[11:24:22] <merdeepcore> like voip / sharing
[11:24:24] <merdeepcore> yes
[11:24:25] <merdeepcore> p2p
[11:24:32] <zetok> hmm
[11:24:37] <merdeepcore> are you a coder ?
[11:24:51] <zetok> Rust, bash
[11:24:55] <merdeepcore>  isee
[11:25:27] <merdeepcore> in fact it's the first time I see this 
[11:25:41] <zetok> do the other p2p programs use hole-punching?
[11:26:51] <merdeepcore> skype does it fine
[11:26:56] <merdeepcore> no ?
[11:27:07] <zetok> yes and no
[11:27:13] <merdeepcore> behind nat
[11:27:14] <zetok> it doesn't maintain as many connections
[11:27:18] <zetok> (I think)
[11:27:29] <merdeepcore> why does qtox has to maintain more conenctions than skype for example ?
[11:27:41] <zetok> qTox is distributed
[11:27:49] <merdeepcore> its like 10 nodes
[11:27:49] <zetok> that's basically it
[11:27:57] <merdeepcore> and it ddoses the router
[11:28:05] <merdeepcore> isnt that extreme
[11:28:35] <merdeepcore> and why do we need hole punching for p2p
[11:28:53] <zetok> to have connections without opening ports manually
[11:29:11] <merdeepcore> isnt this what upnp is for
[11:31:15] <merdeepcore> do I need hole punching to do p2p ?
[11:31:22] <merdeepcore> if I can have my ports open ?
[11:34:49] <merdeepcore> well anyway I think qtox crashing 6 out of 10 routers should considered a bug and not blame the routers
[11:35:14] <zetok> well, those routers are shitty
[11:35:15] <merdeepcore> you might as well blame the x86 architecture for whatever or ipv4/6
[11:35:36] <zetok> it just reflects the sad reality of "embedded" stuff
[11:35:53] <merdeepcore> what embedded
[11:36:00] <merdeepcore> half of these are different modem / routers
[11:36:04] <zetok> but yeah, I get that stuff should work better even with crappy routers
[11:36:17] <merdeepcore> i use the tplink ac1750 + cisco modem
[11:36:32] <merdeepcore> if u consider this crap, then 90% routers are crap
[11:36:38] <merdeepcore> which I would kinda agree
[11:36:46] <merdeepcore> but its not how we should approach this problem
[11:37:01] <merdeepcore> when other programs can handle this without the router dying
[11:37:17] <merdeepcore> and why do we need hole punching for p2p with upnp
[11:37:36] <zetok> upnp doesn't work everywhere
[11:37:49] <zetok> anyway
[11:38:06] <merdeepcore> would it be super difficult to implenent upnp without hole punchingt ?
[11:38:08] <zetok> merdeepcore: would you mind opening an issue with the data on https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore ?
[11:38:26] <merdeepcore> it would make tox run"able" at every computer
[11:38:31] <merdeepcore> rather than 40% of computers
[11:38:32] <zetok> um, I don't know if that's due to hole-punching
[11:38:34] <merdeepcore> sure 
[11:38:41] <merdeepcore> I will submit it
[11:39:00] <merdeepcore> also why are smiley packs inside dlls ?
[11:39:06] <merdeepcore> and hardcoded ?
[11:39:10] <merdeepcore> any reason for this ?
[11:39:20] <zetok> yep, easier to do
[11:39:27] <merdeepcore> i can help you make it better
[11:39:32] <merdeepcore> i work at disney :)
[11:39:33] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/milestone/12
[11:39:39] <zetok> would be awesome :)
[11:40:04] <merdeepcore> we need to implement custom shortcuts
[11:40:06] <merdeepcore> and packs
[11:42:51] <merdeepcore> yeah that submission on smileys is spot on
[11:56:11] <merdeepcore> ok submitted
[11:56:13] <merdeepcore> cheers
[12:20:14] <zetok> thanks :)
