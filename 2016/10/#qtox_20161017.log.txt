[00:27:48] <Thorm> Hey @zetok
[00:27:53] <zetok> o/
[00:29:39] <Thorm> I wasn't able to get qtox building on windows. The main issue is that you need a reliable version of mingw64 and QT64bit with Mingw64 which doesn't exist without building it yourself(a very complicated and painful proccess).
[00:30:00] <zetok> :|
[00:30:04] <Thorm> https://wiki.qt.io/MinGW-64-bit
[00:30:37] <Thorm> I think at this point building natively on windows is somewhat a lost cause until QT comes out with a prebuilt version
[00:30:53] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3372 ‚Üê would be good to add that info here
[00:30:58] <Thorm> Which devs have been asking for since ~2012
[00:33:54] <Thorm> Ok I'll add some info
[00:34:07] <zetok> thanks :)
[00:34:11] <Thorm> BTW this is @AliceGrey

[00:37:49] <zetok> I wonder how I've managed to forged about that post
[00:37:55] <zetok> forget*
[00:38:06] <Thorm> It looks like he got it working using MYSYS2 which is basically linux running on windows. I came to the conclusion from https://wiki.qt.io/MinGW-64-bit that you would need MYSYS2
[00:39:04] <zetok> oh, I see
[00:40:45] <Thorm> Hopefully he makes a PR
[00:40:55] <Thorm> Because I got stuck

[07:11:55] <Diadl0> zetok, Thorm: Is it possible (after INSTALL.md will be updated) to write script for windows, which will build qTox automatically?
[07:38:13] <zetok> on windows, not really I think
[07:39:48] <zetok> script for cross-compiling using docker, that's what already happens on TokTok/qTox
