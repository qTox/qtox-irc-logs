[22:09:51] <zetok> iphy: roger
[22:11:15] <sudden6> do you think there's a way to make the rebase | wait for travis | merge --ff-only | push to master dance less time consuming?
[22:11:36] <sudden6> because travis is taking 10-15 minutes to verify the PR after rebase
[22:11:52] <sudden6> so merging own PRs is a lot slower than foreign..

[22:12:43] <zetok> actually
[22:12:52] <zetok> s/git push -f/git sync/
[22:13:17] <zetok> you could put that in a loop until it would work
[22:13:49] <zetok> so you wouldn't even have to care about checking whether someone pushed stuff in meanwhile
[22:14:38] <sudden6> doesn't look like "The easy solution™" I was lookng for ^^
[22:14:46] <zetok> would just work™ concurrently with your other branches as well
[22:16:33] <sudden6> zetok: did you already push the i18n fix to master?
[22:16:44] <zetok> nope
[22:17:40] <sudden6> ah, so how do I do that?
[22:17:55] <zetok> push to the branch, reopen PR?
[22:18:22] <zetok> or make a new PR if reopening doesn't work
[22:24:39] <sudden6> zetok: done

[22:30:35] <sudden6> Diadlo: https://reviewable.io/reviews/qtox/qtox/3774 -> why is validator a pointer again?
[22:31:08] <Diadlo> sudden6: Because `setValidator` required pointer :)
[22:32:13] <sudden6> ok, was blind again :)
[22:32:22] <Diadlo> But if we will send `&validator` it will be invalid after exit from scope
[22:32:52] <sudden6> yep, I thought it'll create a memleak again, but you set the parent :)
[22:33:18] <Diadlo> Exactly ;)

[22:34:21] <sudden6> sometimes I wonder if I'm even qualified to review C++ code lol
[22:34:40] <Diadlo> +1
[22:35:04] <sudden6> zetok: could you LGTM https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3794 again?
[22:35:25] <zetok> Diadlo: ↑ ?
[22:36:01] <sudden6> Diadlo: to be honest, I'm probably not, but qTox was in need of a reviewer and I had too much time :D
[22:36:41] <Diadlo> What the difference with old PR?
[22:36:48] <Diadlo> About #3794
[22:36:51] <sudden6> Diadlo: hopefully nothing
[22:36:58] <Diadlo> Lol
[22:37:05] <sudden6> I just messed up while trying to rebase it...
[22:37:21] <zetok> sudden6: aren't you missing an `arg()` there?
[22:37:24] <sudden6> git must have sensed my tiredness :D
[22:37:49] <zetok> oh wait
[22:37:53] <sudden6> zetok: no
[22:38:02] <sudden6> first arg() has two parameters :)
[22:38:18] <zetok> yeah, just figured that out >.<
[22:38:55] <Diadlo> We need more brackets to god of brackets!
[22:39:13] <sudden6> zetok: are you sure you don't want to invest in the C++ business and start writing it's glorious code? :P
[22:39:14] * zetok has a relevant pic

[22:43:48] <sudden6> the c# part is really accurate :DD
[22:43:58] <Diadlo> zetok: Oh.. sorry, I think, that `has a relevant pic` was to sudden6 about C++ :)
[22:44:15] <zetok> Diadlo: um, it wasn't
[22:45:30] <sudden6> github should implement something like a merge queue
[22:45:52] <sudden6> you push stuff there and it's merged after it passes travis
[22:46:39] <zetok> merge_it branch & merge_it branch2 & merge_it branch3 &
[22:46:49] <zetok> you can just emulate that locally

[22:47:00] -qtox-git-spam- qTox/master c8bde5b sudden6: fix(i18n): remove HTML from translations...
[22:47:04] <zetok> although that wouldn't be a real queue
[22:47:20] <zetok> unless you'd opt for the synchronous version
[22:47:21] <sudden6> and it requires the reliability of my pc
[22:47:39] <zetok> actually
[22:47:49] <sudden6> which approaches zero as time progresses

[22:56:42] <zetok> I mean, marking as reviewed is not the only thing, any action that does something with the revision would do
