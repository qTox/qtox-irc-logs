[16:10:05] <SkyzohKey> hey guys
[16:10:16] <SkyzohKey> zetok: u can't beat ricin v2 website ;)
[16:10:25] <zetok> SkyzohKey: pls
[16:10:31] <SkyzohKey> But i wanted to ask how your translation system works
[16:10:41] <zetok> Just Works™
[16:10:45] <SkyzohKey> x)
[16:10:55] <SkyzohKey> Tried to adapt it on my code, didn't worked, python error :x
[16:10:57] <SkyzohKey> https://v2.ricin.im
[16:11:30] <zetok> do you use any js?
[16:11:34] <SkyzohKey> nope
[16:11:41] <zetok> oh?
[16:11:52] <SkyzohKey> CSS3 Only™
[16:13:13] <zetok> >nope
[16:13:15] <zetok> that's a lie
[16:13:19] <SkyzohKey> no
[16:14:08] <zetok> turn js off in your browser and see for yourself
[16:14:34] <SkyzohKey> ctrl+u → ctrl+f: .js → 0 result
[16:18:19] *** Joins: sudden6 (~anonymous@ )
[16:18:24] <zetok> right, that reminds me
[16:19:00] <SkyzohKey> even with noscript activated, it just blocks the icons
[16:19:23] *** Joins: sudd3n6 (~anonymous@ )
[16:19:43] <SkyzohKey> and font-icons are hosted on my own cdn, so no data leak
[16:20:02] <zetok> that's not the only thing that's broken
[16:20:08] <SkyzohKey> show me an example
[16:20:14] <zetok> try clicking
[16:20:22] <SkyzohKey> clicking what ?
[16:20:30] <zetok> what is there to click on? :P
[16:20:36] <SkyzohKey> links ?
[16:22:00] <SkyzohKey> if u talk about images pointer cursor, that's normal, i plan to implement something pretty cool soon ;)
[16:22:10] <zetok> nah
[16:22:24] <SkyzohKey> what then ?

[16:25:19] <sudd3n6> nice answer lol
[16:25:30] <zetok> SkyzohKey: download links

[22:06:01] <iphy> I see
[22:06:17] <iphy> so much for having a common coding style between toxcore and qtox
[22:06:39] <oranges> why would you have a common coding style
[22:11:27] <iphy> I thought it would be nice to have a common standard in all tox related projects
[22:11:44] *** oranges is now known as Crusader_King_or
[22:11:53] <zetok> dunno about that
[22:12:00] <sudden6> Isn't that unrealistic?
[22:12:04] <zetok> I just made a PR according to what current style is
[22:12:10] <sudden6> whith all the different languages?
[22:12:16] <iphy> sudden6: C and C++
[22:12:26] <iphy> no need to apply the C/C++ coding style to python
[22:12:33] <sudden6> hm ok
[22:12:38] <iphy> but we would have a common python coding style
[22:12:41] <iphy> and a common scala coding style
[22:12:51] <zetok> I don't really care though, if style will be changed to something else I'm perfectly fine with changing/closing the PR
[22:12:53] <iphy> C and C++ can have the same style
[22:13:22] <sudden6> but even C and C++ are better with different styles IMO
[22:13:44] <sudden6> in C++ you have a lot more confusing operators
[22:14:02] <zetok> iphy: um, if qTox is to share style with other tox stuff, there should be some movement in that direction to begin with
[22:14:13] <sudden6> which I think favorors a more verbose style

[22:45:06] <iphy> sudden6: and which confusing operators?
[22:46:00] <iphy> zetok: if we have a clang-format config we can share with all projects, we're done
[22:46:18] *** Parts: cisc (~cisc@ ) ("Konversation terminated!")
[22:46:56] <zetok> iphy: right, could toxcore one be changed to have curly braces vertically aligned?
[22:47:37] <iphy> zetok: possibly, we'll need to discuss that with all people involved
[22:47:56] <zetok> ok
[22:48:08] <iphy> If we can't find a style we can agree on, at least we can be based on one
[22:53:42] <zetok> where discussion about style should happen?
[22:54:18] <zetok> actually
