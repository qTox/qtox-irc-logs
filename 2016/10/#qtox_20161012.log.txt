[09:21:54] <Agrey> clear
[09:22:11] <oranges> I'm still hosting some qtox updater vm
[09:22:22] <zetok> Yes.
[09:23:19] <oranges> it's doing about 105 gb out bound each month, so qtox must have a lot of users

[09:26:29] <zetok> 105000 / 20 = 5250
[09:26:37] <zetok> that's not a lot
[09:27:35] <zetok> sudden6: hai :)
[09:27:50] <zetok> sudden6: right on time, https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3808#issuecomment-253148609 ← opinion?
[09:28:15] <oranges> where did you get 20 from
[09:28:48] <zetok> isn't that the size of compressed qTox?
[09:29:02] <oranges> it's 20mb?
[09:29:09] <oranges> BLOAT
[09:29:14] <zetok> hmm
[09:29:18] <zetok> perhaps a bit smaller
[09:30:17] <zetok> 22M
[09:30:20] <zetok> almost

[12:46:18] <sudden6> ok, at it :)
[12:46:28] <sudden6> rest is ok?
[12:46:43] <zetok> sec, didn't look at the change yet
[12:47:58] <zetok> sudden6: um, adding a wrong example is kinda confusing
[12:48:18] <sudden6> so remove the wrong example?
[12:48:42] <sudden6> and leave only the note about not using <>?
[12:48:48] <zetok> `#include <core.h>  // ← NOPE` probably wouldn't be confusing
[12:49:05] <zetok> not sure what is better :s
