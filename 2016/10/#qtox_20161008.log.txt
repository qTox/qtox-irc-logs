[21:59:11] <sudden6> I don't see any rule stating function doc should be separated from function
[21:59:42] <Diadlo> > Don't put docs in .h files, if there is a corresponding .cpp file.
[22:00:16] <sudden6> no, I don't mean that
[22:01:19] <Diadlo> Ok. What you mean?
[22:01:23] <sudden6> ah, wait
[22:01:52] <sudden6> I didn't see that     inline static QString getSound(Sound s) { is declared and implemented in the .h file
[22:02:02] <Diadlo> Yep)
[22:02:27] <sudden6> have I overlooked any reason to put it there?
[22:02:40] <Diadlo> It's inline
[22:02:57] <Diadlo> By antis81 decision
[22:03:10] <Diadlo> s/decision/example/
[22:03:11] <sudden6> AFAIR inline functions can be in .cpp files? can't they?
[22:03:35] <Diadlo> Only if they used in this .cpp file
[22:03:58] <Diadlo> Otherwise it will provide error
[22:03:58] <sudden6> is this different in c++ than c?
[22:04:03] <Diadlo> IDK
[22:04:34] <Diadlo> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3992980/c-inline-member-function-in-cpp-file#3993003
[22:06:11] <sudden6> hmm, seems it's really different in c++
[22:06:22] <sudden6> or I didn't hit that case in c yet
[22:06:40] <Diadlo> You can just try it)
[22:08:00] <sudden6> on my way ;)

[22:16:29] <sudden6> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5057021/why-are-c-inline-functions-in-the-header
[22:16:34] <sudden6> seems to answer it
[22:16:56] <sudden6> and at the same time rises the question why we should even inline this function
[22:17:56] <sudden6> I think this is basically a micro optimization with an unsure benefit
[22:18:09] <Diadlo> For the same reason, as always?) little bit more performance
[22:21:28] <Diadlo> I don't sure, that we have important reason to do it inline ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[22:23:03] <sudden6> yeah, the problem I see here is that blindly "optimizing" stuff can actually hinder the compilers work of optimizing the program
[22:24:03] <Diadlo> AFAIK, inline can't hinder optimizing
[22:24:16] <sudden6> in C it can
[22:24:23] <Diadlo> How?
[22:24:51] <sudden6> if you start to inline large functions this could fill up the cpu cache
[22:25:02] <sudden6> this is an extreme example
[22:25:06] <Diadlo> Ok
[22:25:54] <sudden6> Basically the opinion is that without much experience/research/profiling the compiler is better on optimizing than a single human
[22:26:59] <Diadlo> Better ask antis81 why he use `inline` here)
[22:27:26] <sudden6> yeah, I won't atm
[22:27:32] <sudden6> I'll leave it as it is
[22:27:44] <sudden6> I just wanted to voice my opinion
[22:32:35] *** Quits: abbat (~Anton@ ) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[22:32:55] <sudden6> hmm, this discussion inspired me to try and enable LTO for qTox
[22:33:28] <Diadlo> What is LTO?
[22:33:41] <sudden6> link time optimization
[22:34:08] <sudden6> basically the compiler delays the optimization process until the linker stage and then optimizes the whole program
[22:34:20] <sudden6> not only separate compilation units
[22:35:07] <Diadlo> sudden6: Merge https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3791 ?
