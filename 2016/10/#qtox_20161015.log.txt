[20:42:12] <Diadl0> zetok: Good idea
[20:42:38] <Diadl0> And I have a little problem. What I should do with windows bootstrap and build scripts?
[20:42:54] <zetok> :s

[20:43:13] <Diadl0> Form build.tox.chat

[20:46:12] <Diadl0> Ok
[21:07:18] *** Joins: grayhatter (grayhatter@ )
[21:08:42] <grayhatter> what do you think about toxcore restarting on it's own every <amount of time> as a temporary fix for some of the problems. Including rotating session keys regularly, as well as the "friend is offline" lie bug that's hard to find.
[21:18:32] <zetok> restarting is a bad idea
[21:18:55] <zetok> and keys should be rotated regardless of whether toxcore is being restarted
[21:19:27] <zetok> and if user wants to go through the pain of restarting toxcore, they have a button for it
[21:20:12] <grayhatter> zetok there's no other way without implementing key renegoation
[21:20:38] <zetok> :)
[21:21:00] <grayhatter> and it wouldn't change anything the client see, apart from going offline for a 1/10th of a second, before coming back online
[21:21:13] <grayhatter> all friends would disconnect, then reconnect when the key changes
[21:21:18] <zetok> that's not how restarting toxcore works
[21:21:26] <zetok> it goes down for *minutes*
[21:21:46] <Diadl0> grayhatter: It will not provide audio/video disconnect?
[21:22:17] <grayhatter> zetok not if you're doing it correctly
[21:22:21] <Diadl0> For my experience reconnect is longer than few second
[21:22:25] <Diadl0> Ok
[21:22:41] <grayhatter> yeah, that's a whole toxcore restart, where it'll have to bootstrap again
[21:22:57] <zetok> err
[21:23:07] <zetok> ><grayhatter> what do you think about toxcore restarting (…)
[21:23:25] <grayhatter> it'll take approx 30s-2m for it to refind it's place in the DHT and reannounce so newly online friends can find you
[21:23:39] <zetok> yeah, that's unacceptable
[21:24:00] <grayhatter> but any friend you're already connected to will disconnect and reconnect within 1-3s
[21:24:16] <grayhatter> given normal network conditions
[21:24:57] <zetok> if it can disrupt audio/video call, then it's a no-go IMO
[21:25:02] <zetok> or a file transfer
[21:25:11] <grayhatter> zetok yeah, I was thinking about that
[21:25:27] <grayhatter> it would also be trivial to delay while there's an existing FT/AV
[21:25:55] <zetok> what about bandwidth usage?
[21:26:51] <zetok> hmm
[21:27:14] <zetok> "normal network conditions" doesn't include saturated connection, right?
[21:27:15] <grayhatter> it would actually probably go down
[21:27:23] <zetok> nope
[21:27:27] <grayhatter> zetok that is correct
[21:27:38] <zetok> bandwidth usage is very high when restarting/starting toxcore
[21:27:47] <grayhatter> if toxcore is already killing your nat, this will make it kill it faster/more often
[21:27:51] <zetok> high enough to saturate the connection
[21:28:15] <zetok> which means that friends won't disconnect & reconnect within 1-3 seconds
[21:28:48] <grayhatter> zetok it means that NO connection will disconnect and reconnect within 1-3s
[21:29:54] <zetok> so we're looking at 30s-2min even for friends that are online
[21:32:38] <Diadl0> What you think about closing #3645?

[22:08:32] <Diadl0> What change?
[22:09:41] <zetok> the change that this PR tries to do

[22:19:05] <Thorm> Anyone on who has experince building qtox on Windows? I'm trying to build from github in a windows vm.
[22:19:33] <Thorm> I'm getting vpx/vpx_image.h: No such file or directory. For some reason ffmpeg from bootstrep isn't giving me vpx?
[22:23:58] <Diadl0> zetok: This PR do simple changes. And this changes is wrong (see initramfs comment)
[22:24:37] <zetok> Thorm: sounds more like libvpx is missing
[22:25:04] <zetok> Thorm: if you're using pre-built toxcore binaries, they should include libvpx..
[22:25:59] <zetok> Diadl0: 1. it seems bot fix stuff for bashrc; 2. yes, it's wrong, but there are no open PRs that would do it right
[22:26:10] <zetok> s/bot/to/
[22:26:13] <Thorm> @zetok Does bootstrap get toxcore and build it?
[22:26:40] <zetok> Thorm: it tries to download & extract zip with its binaries
[22:27:19] <Diadl0> Ok, I leave it open only because 1'st reason. Second one it wrong
[22:27:33] <Thorm> @zetok I have libtox.dll in the libs dir and the zip file. I didn't get any errors from bootstrap.
[22:28:23] <Thorm> @zetok, is it possible bootstrap isn't building in libvpx?
[22:28:56] <zetok> well, bootstrap isn't building it AFAIR
[22:29:34] <Thorm> @zetok, I think you are right. It looks like it jsut grabs the release
[22:29:58] <Thorm> It downloaded libtoxcore_build_windows_x86_shared_release.zip
[22:32:05] <Thorm> @zetok, there is code in the bootstrap to build toxcore though.
[22:32:11] <Diadl0> zetok: If someone will open PR with <nothing useful> and mark it as `Fix #<issue>` there is no reason to leave it open, becouse "there are no open PRs that would do it right"
[22:32:30] <zetok> Diadl0: yep
[22:33:35] <Thorm> @zetok, libtoxcore starts at line 130 in bootstrap.sh

[22:41:02] <Thorm> @Chiitoo, I run linux, I was trying to test building on windows to see if it works for bug testing purposes.
[22:41:19] <zetok> right now it doesn't
[22:41:49] <Chiitoo> That'sd why I stopped doing it on Windows, since it feels too much of unnecessary work. :]
[22:42:16] <Chiitoo> But indeed, if one really wants to make that work, then yeah.
[22:42:34] <Thorm> @zetok, ok if I grab https://build.tox.chat/job/libvpx_build_windows_x86_static_release/21/ I can get past the vpx missing
[22:43:10] <zetok> Thorm: good to know, mind making a PR with a fix?

[22:44:36] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/windows/bootstrap.sh#L52,L69
[22:44:56] <Chiitoo> One of the things that made me give up, was the fact that the during the build process, the Windows things just died, and makes it all so very flaky.
[22:45:17] <Chiitoo> Almost sure it's nothing we can really make better even, without even more work.
[22:45:19] <Thorm> Let me check the build logs....
[22:45:35] <Thorm> Hmmm ok so openal build is throwing an error on windows
[22:45:50] <Thorm> unknown type time_t
[22:46:03] <Thorm> *unknown type name time_t
[22:46:07] <zetok> :/
[22:46:33] <Thorm> Could we have jenkins build openal for windows like it does for libvpx?
[22:46:51] <zetok> it's already built there
[22:46:55] <Chiitoo> (I think it was during ffmpeg build, that I would get Windows thingies crash, but the build actually continued in the background, slowly, and would eventually succeed.)
[22:47:10] <Thorm> @zetok, link?
[22:47:19] <Chiitoo> All the dependencies are built by Jenkins.
[22:47:35] <zetok> Thorm: dunno, I just know that it's built there since jenkins builds qTox for windows
[22:48:05] <Chiitoo> That's why I just grab the deps from there, and build only qTox.
[22:48:22] <Thorm> found it
[22:48:32] <Thorm> should I use shared or static release?
[22:49:08] <zetok> generally, static is better
[22:49:24] <Thorm> Ok :)
[22:49:27] <Thorm> Building....
[22:49:38] <Thorm> Fingers crossed
[22:50:18] <Chiitoo> If you'd like to have just a 'qtox.exe', static definitely.  :]

[22:53:48] <zetok> it would be also good to bump ffmpeg if they've made a new release with fix for windows breakage

[23:08:42] <Thorm> So....does that mean we need to be using mingw64 fow windows builds?
[23:08:52] <zetok> :|
[23:09:07] <zetok> sounds like it
[23:09:10] <Thorm> FML
[23:10:25] <Chiitoo> You need version 4.0.6 or so too, to build with ffmpeg-3.
[23:10:48] <Thorm> Ok
[23:10:55] <Thorm> Let me test this
[23:11:10] <Chiitoo> At least that, I mean.
[23:11:45] <Chiitoo> Or maybe something before that... but not something Debian normally provides, for example.  :]
[23:12:02] <Chiitoo> Haven't looked at the Windows installers in a while.

[23:29:51] <Chiitoo> But, I was building only 32-bit versions with that... I think, so that might explain something.
[23:30:05] <Chiitoo> Another reason perhaps why I chose crossbuilding.

[23:32:44] <Chiitoo> And yeah, just noticed that project as well, but never tried it, from the looks of it.
[23:33:26] <Thorm> I'm testing it now
[23:33:30] <Thorm> Seems to be working
[23:33:56] <Thorm> Just have to grab the libs
[23:34:51] <Thorm> So far so good...
[23:39:41] <Thorm> FML
[23:40:05] <Thorm> @zetok, @Chiitoo we are back to the qglobal error

[23:40:17] <Thorm> That's the build log
[23:41:06] *** Quits: sudden6 (~anonymous@ ) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:43:37] <Thorm> @zetok, @Chiitoo Maybe I need cmake x64
[23:45:52] <Chiitoo> Hm, yeah, I'd probably look at what the 'mingw-get' does, with regards to dependencies, if you're using things outside of it.  Might indeed be missing something.
[23:46:03] <Chiitoo> Don't have any immediate ideas myself, but am interested.  ^^
[23:53:36] <Thorm> @Chiitoo, found this https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=725079#c3
[23:58:45] <Thorm> In qtox.pro line 41 rtti is set to off.
[23:59:30] <Thorm> That might be the problem
[23:59:36] <Thorm> Testing now
[23:59:44] <Chiitoo> Hmmm, pretty old, and closed as 'notabug' though.  I wonder.
