[12:04:39] <sudden6> I'm not that sure https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3827 will make it into 1.6 anymore, initramfs and Diadlo changed some things in ways I didn't expect

[12:58:38] *** Joins: Chiitoo (~Chiitoo@ )
[13:09:41] <sudden6> zetok: the idea is ~, the rust advertising is horrible
[13:10:48] <sudden6> with your data format it doesn't even need a separate lib
[13:11:13] <sudden6> just a definition of keys and their corresponding values
[13:11:54] <sudden6> of course a lib would simiplify stuff a little bit, but for the essential idea it's unneccessary
[13:14:57] *** Joins: Diadl0 (~Diadlo@ )
[13:19:21] <sudden6> correction, the idea isn't that good :/
[13:19:58] <sudden6> even if we implemented it like in your idea, everyone would have to basically have a json parser
[13:20:31] <sudden6> altough it could be in your lib, it will increase the attack surface drastically
[13:20:57] <sudden6> and would again make it hard for minimal clients to still be portable

[14:50:18] <sudden6> somthing that's not in toxcore

[15:05:49] <initramfs> iphy: If I may share my two-cents, I would glady accept a JSON parser/writer as a dependency if it can solve the save format issue
[15:06:13] <iphy> I think the whole save format should go away
[15:07:10] <initramfs> You mean the current format?
[15:07:32] <iphy> yes, and toxcore shouldn't do any save formatting
[15:07:41] <initramfs> Right
[15:08:04] <initramfs> That... is probably a good idea actually
[15:08:26] <initramfs> Since clients will no doubt already be saving extra data outside of toxcore
[15:08:34] <iphy> larger clients yes

[15:09:04] <initramfs> Hmm
[15:10:30] <initramfs> What about having toxcore define an save spec that requires clients to implement
[15:10:39] <zetok> err
[15:10:41] <initramfs> WIth an extensible section for custom data
[15:11:12] <zetok> it should go like that
[15:11:33] <zetok> except that clients shouldn't do it, but it should be done in a lib that clients would use
[15:12:06] <iphy> right
[15:12:36] <zetok> um, what I proposed if version 0.0.0, something to just get going
[15:12:37] <initramfs> Well... that boils down to "extract saving into it's own library"

[15:14:00] <initramfs> iphy: This is unrelated but, do you know if clang-format has any rules to tweak the way lambdas are formatted?
[15:14:11] <iphy> I don't know
[15:14:13] <initramfs> I thought they would just follow the rules for functions
[15:14:15] <initramfs> But no
[15:14:21] <initramfs> They have their own non-tweakable rules

[18:23:22] <Diadlo> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3823#issuecomment-257088712
[18:23:43] <Diadlo> About moving history init in init list
[18:23:50] <Diadlo> Why you think, that it's better?
[18:24:33] <Diadlo> I absolutely do not mind. Just wanted to know arguments
[18:24:59] <sudden6> Diadlo: I don't think it's that good, because of my PR
[18:25:32] <sudden6> to decrypt the database we then need the ToxID which is only available when toxcore is started
[18:26:00] <Diadlo> sudden6: Ok. initramfs, so I leave it?
[18:26:09] <sudden6> so i need to load the database asynchronous
[18:26:29] <sudden6> I just don't know if that's the right way to do
[18:27:03] <Diadlo> sudden6: Do you plan to write db converter?
[18:27:14] <sudden6> db converter?
[18:27:14] <Diadlo> To save user history
[18:27:20] <initramfs> Huh
[18:27:26] <initramfs> Okay I need to read both your PRs
[18:27:26] <sudden6> yes, it's already in the PR
[18:28:06] <Diadlo> Ok. I planned read it after merge of my :)
[18:28:36] <zetok> >to decrypt the database we then need the ToxID
[18:28:41] <sudden6> maybe that's still the better approach, merging yours and then adapt stuff in my PR
[18:28:43] <zetok> sudden6: um
[18:28:59] <zetok> sudden6: do you *really* depend on ToxID and not the PK?
[18:29:09] <sudden6> zetok: yes, it's the PK

[19:09:01] <sudden6> getToxId().publickey
[19:09:11] <zetok> >getToxId()
[19:09:36] <sudden6> what do you want to say?
[19:10:07] <zetok> that it's a leftover thing from the time when tux3 thought that it's a good idea to try to save friend's "ID"
[19:11:03] <sudden6> I can't see anything wrong with that

[21:57:10] <initramfs> Umm, should I review your PR?
[21:57:20] <initramfs> You seem to encoperate stuff from Diadlo's PR
[21:57:24] <initramfs> and outdated stuff too
[21:57:29] <sudden6> yeah it's based on it
[21:57:54] <sudden6> only the last commit is my own work
[21:58:02] <initramfs> Hmm
[21:58:14] <initramfs> Because in your PR, RawDatabase is still references
[21:58:24] <initramfs> Diadlo's changed it to shared_ptrs
[21:59:10] <sudden6> I rebased it this morning, so if he changed anything between it's not up to date
[21:59:54] <sudden6> and I don't quite have a clue about the differences between shared_ptr and a traditional pointer
[22:00:14] <sudden6> so I used the pointer to make the compiler happy
[22:01:01] <initramfs> Hmm
[22:01:10] <initramfs> Okay this is gonna be weird
[22:01:18] <initramfs> So you want me to only review your code right?
[22:01:40] <sudden6> you know what, don't waste your time on that
[22:01:51] <sudden6> this won't make it into 1.6 anyway
[22:02:13] <sudden6> I'll rebase it tomorrow and then you can take a look
[22:02:15] <initramfs> I really think we should push 1.6 back a week
[22:02:27] <initramfs> None of the Prs that were scheduled are probably gonna make it

[22:02:42] <sudden6> zetok: ↑?
[22:02:51] <sudden6> I also thought of that
[22:02:54] <zetok> I don't see any problem with delaying release a week
[22:02:59] <sudden6> would definitely be an option
