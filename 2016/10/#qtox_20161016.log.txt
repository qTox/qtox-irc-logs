[00:01:09] <Thorm> Yup it's rtti
[00:01:30] <Thorm> I deleted "rtti_off" and added rtti and it got passed that part
[00:01:37] <Thorm> Now adding qrencode libs
[00:02:14] <Thorm> It's compiling emojis now :D Farthest it's gotten
[00:02:52] <Thorm> So we might need to edit qtox.pro 
[00:04:45] <Thorm> Got another error

[00:28:02] <Daiwo> I wouldn't this so, but .. just wondering , Does qTox support SIP ?Y
[00:36:54] <Chiitoo> Thorm: I don't really know, but that seems like it might be trying to execute a thing under 'C:\Program Files[...]', and it's being word-split.  Hence it just sees 'C:\Program'.  Whatever it is.
[00:37:01] <Thorm> @zetok, @Chiitoo I think it's because I installed mingw-w64 in Program Files, testing that theory
[00:37:28] <Thorm> Installing to C:\MinGW64
[00:42:58] <Chiitoo> Would seem a bit odd that they/it didn't protect them paths!
[00:43:19] <Thorm> WINDOWS
[00:43:20] <Thorm> lol
[00:43:34] <Chiitoo> True.  Heh.
[00:46:53] <Thorm> compiling...

[00:52:29] <Thorm> Cya guys
[00:52:33] <Chiitoo> Different error?
[00:52:39] <Chiitoo> Have a good work!
[02:17:47] <Daiwo> Thorm
[02:18:29] <Daiwo> you got me resurfaced some deep old question I had years ago ..
[02:19:41] <Daiwo> what are the guideline as to wether we should install an app in C:/ vs the MS's recommended way (ie %ProgramFiles%/(x86)%) ?
[02:20:44] <Daiwo> I had Conemu installed in %PF% before, but for some unreasearched conclusion, I prefer it to sit in C:/ .... still my reasoning remains unanswered
[02:20:54] <Daiwo> If you find some time to light me up on that, I'd love to
[02:20:55] <Daiwo> :)
[02:21:35] <Daiwo> btw. I'm french, so please forgive my eye-burning english
