[07:46:43] <zetok> yep
[07:46:45] <Diadl0> https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme
[07:47:22] <Diadl0> What about reformat README?
[07:49:56] <Diadl0> Move screenshot/logo on the top, to attract attention
[07:57:03] <Diadl0> This label absolutely useless on the bottom of README.md https://camo.githubusercontent.com/12b0005615bad24e6794d34f091b881eff14fab5/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f71546f782f71546f782e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572

[07:57:52] <zetok> I've moved it there since qTox builds at the time were being constantly broken
[07:58:13] <zetok> looks like it's time to move it back
[07:59:40] <Diadl0> On screenshots we didn't show circles
[07:59:55] <zetok> yeah

[09:02:05] <Diadl0> zetok: What you think about using? ^

[09:03:44] <Diadl0> Why?
[09:04:44] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] Diadlo closed pull request #3822: Separate UserDb from History class (master...userDb) https://git.io/vPypO
[09:05:11] <zetok> right now docs have to build in order for tests to pass
[09:06:14] <zetok> solution used for deploying isn't really bound to a proprietary service, and could be easily reused with gitlab
[09:06:49] <zetok> or own vps
[09:07:27] <Diadl0> Ok. Understand
[09:09:45] <zetok> um, why close the PR?
[09:12:33] <Diadl0> To rewrite something. Soon I will open new one :)
[09:14:29] <zetok> oh, ok
[09:15:16] <zetok> rerumnovarum: README.md; it probably could make some use of improvements, but I'm not sure what those would be
[09:15:50] <zetok> I mean, I have a few things on mind, but those aren't a real plan, just some minor stuff that needs to be moved around
[09:16:23] <zetok> ..
[09:16:41] <zetok> damn, hexchat autocompleted again :/

[09:21:37] <oranges> could you repeat the question?

[09:23:24] <Diadl0> Becouse, he is went away for a some time, I think we should split it on smaller ones
[09:29:20] <zetok> https://github.com/hexchat/hexchat/issues/1850 there we go
[09:30:18] <zetok> Diadl0: yeah, that's a good idea
