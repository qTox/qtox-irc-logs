[16:36:21] <sudden6> hi initramfs do you have time? :)
[16:36:34] <initramfs> A little bit
[16:36:37] <initramfs> Why?
[16:37:04] <sudden6> in https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3827/commits/740f414389e9b9cad9cb591f73bec474796a6e9d
[16:37:16] <sudden6> I made Profile derived from QObject
[16:37:34] <sudden6> to be able to connect it with signals and slots
[16:38:16] <sudden6> Is there a way to avoid making it a QObject and still connect one of the functions to a signal?
[16:40:11] <initramfs> Well, I think you can have a non-Qt object connect as a slot
[16:41:45] <sudden6> Another thing, would it be bad if Profile is derived from QObject?
[16:42:24] <initramfs> Ehh... That's hard to say...
[16:42:50] <initramfs> I mean, if it's necessary, sure. But otherwise, we don't need to couple classes unrelated to the UI with Qt
[16:43:52] <sudden6> I found no other way to load the database asynchronously
[16:44:13] <zetok> >load the database asynchronously
[16:44:18] <initramfs> Well, the signal-slot system is just a complex version of callbacks
[16:44:22] <zetok> this sounds like something that could break
[16:44:58] <initramfs> In a trivial case where there is one signal connecting to one slot. That's just a single callback
[16:45:08] <sudden6> zetok: true, but I couldn't come up with a better way
[16:45:21] <initramfs> But using signals and slots probably simplifies design
[16:45:36] <sudden6> and so far it works™
[16:46:24] <sudden6> also the signal is in another thread, I think the signals slot stuff helps things not to break
[16:47:11] <initramfs> Right

[18:08:52] <nurupo> ><sudden6> Is there a way to avoid making it a QObject and still connect one of the functions to a signal? <-- slots are regular functions, your object doesn't have to derive from QObject to use any of it's functions/methods as slots
[18:14:42] <nurupo> talking about signal-slots. you know how when you connect a signal emitted from a worker thread to the slot of an object from the main thread, the connection would automatically be Qt::QueuedConnection?
[18:16:05] <nurupo> this doesn't work if you connect a signal emmited from a worder thread to a lambda function created in the main thread
[18:17:21] <nurupo> this auto-detection of whether to use Qt::DirectConnection or Qt::QueuedConnection works only for QObjects, because they have thread affinity (i.e. there is a member in QObject saying to which thread it belongs)
[18:18:51] <nurupo> explicitly specifying Qt::QueuedConnection for a such lambda connection doesn't work either, since it wouldn't know in which thread you want the lambda to be executed

[19:02:20] <tux3> Slackware
[19:02:36] *** Joins: jjuran (~jjuran@ )
[19:02:40] <zetok> did they use what slackware provides for compiling qTox?
[19:02:50] <zetok> (listed in INSTALL.md)
[19:03:09] <tux3> Not sure. It's a linking error due to a missing 64bit atomic operation
[19:03:17] <tux3> In the videoframe code
[19:03:29] <zetok> :|
[19:03:34] <zetok> not intentional
[19:04:00] <tux3> Good news is it's probably trivial to fix by replacing a *uint64* by *uint32* in videoframe.h
[19:04:46] <zetok> wait
[19:04:58] <zetok> uint64 in C++ doesn't compile on 32 bits?
[19:05:05] <initramfs> ?
[19:05:09] <initramfs> That seems wrong
[19:05:17] <sudden6> very wrong
[19:05:25] <tux3> No, it's an atomic uint64 thing
[19:05:26] <zetok> u64 in Rust compiles just fine on 32bit OSes
[19:05:44] <tux3> Normal uint64 works, but std::atomic_uint_fast64_t is not natively supported
[19:05:59] <zetok> ;_;
[19:06:01] <initramfs> Urg..
[19:06:03] <tux3> So you'd need a library to emulate the atomic using a lock (I think), and that causes a link error...
[19:06:39] <initramfs> I suppose a 32-bit frame ID would work for now
[19:06:57] <initramfs> That particular code gives every individual frame an ID
[19:07:18] <initramfs> So unless you have an insanely high FPS camera, running an open video session for years, it won't overflow
[19:07:40] <tux3> Yeah at 60FPS it should take 6 months to overflow :)
[19:08:28] <sudden6> I locked qTox to 60fps ;)
[19:08:42] <initramfs> 6 months?
[19:08:54] <zetok> 1194444.4444444445 hours @ 30 fps
[19:08:58] <sudden6> had an interesting experience with a 120fps cam ;)

[19:15:18] <zetok> https://github.com/ivanceras/svgbobrus ← not a serious suggestion
