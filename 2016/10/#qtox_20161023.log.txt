[00:20:30] <nurupo> ><sudd3n6> it's still unversioned and distros don't like unversioned things <-- it looks like everyone will switch to toktok/toxcore sooner or later, which is versioned. uTox's develop branch, i.e. the next stable release, is based on toktok/toxcore. there is also some branch of qTox compatible with toktok/toxcore somewhere, either in iphy's or tux3's or both repos
[00:33:55] <nurupo> ><cisc> then what is this https://build.tox.chat/view/Clients/job/qTox_build_linux_x86-64_release/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/qTox_build_linux_x86-64_release.tar.xz <-- this is qTox from July 6th https://build.tox.chat/view/Clients/job/qTox_build_linux_x86-64_release/ . tux3 was the one maintaining linux qTox builds on Jenkins and after the switch to OBS he said he won't maintain them anymore. Encrypt said he would maintain linux qTox on jenkins in 
[00:33:55] <nurupo> tux3's stead, but he has been busy so it doesn't seem like that would happen anytime soon. i probably should just purge linux qTox builds/pacakges from jenkins at this point, they are outdated, not maintained and fail to build. moreover the static builds are actually not static enough, pretty sure they won't run on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS because of incompatible glibc/libstdc++ versions and they might not run on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, though i'm not as sure about 
[00:33:55] <nurupo> that. to build static binaries that run on most systems you got build them on the oldest system that you want to support, as it would have the oldest glibc/libstdc++, which are backward compatible, but we use Debian Jessie to build them, which is newer than some systems people try to run qTox on
[00:42:32] <nurupo> ><cisc> OBS is your central point of failure <-- you can host your own instance of OBS (Open Build Service http://openbuildservice.org/ ) if you want, you'd need a server for that though. afaik abbat's build scripts are stored in a GH repo, so i assume if OBS (openSUSE Build Service https://build.opensuse.org/ ) goes down, no critical information that would stop you from setting up builds on your own OBS instance would be lost, as long as you have 
[00:42:32] <nurupo> access to that GH repo

[01:09:31] <nurupo> where does jackd come from in that recipe?
[01:11:18] <nurupo> 1) does appimage build it from source or 2) you have to build it yourself, make sure that it will run on "dist: trusty", and give it to appimage?

[08:40:05] <zetok> genesis: last time I've looked (a couple of months ago) appimage didn't really differ from just making a static binary, except for the cool name
[08:40:32] <zetok> i.e. hard and time consuming for C++
[08:42:23] <zetok> and it wouldn't even work as a static binary, at which point it's close to being useless

[20:11:39] <Diadl0> sudden6: Hi. Why not? IIRC antis81 planned to change it on QByteArray
[20:12:01] <sudden6> well it's raw bytes and should be saved as such imo
[20:12:17] <sudden6> and it causes headaches for me right now...
[20:12:56] <zetok> hmm.
[20:13:27] <Diadl0> It's just implementation question. I think, you can change it
[20:13:51] <sudden6> ok
[20:14:26] <sudden6> because I need the key as uint8_t[] to feed it back into toxencryptsave

[21:25:15] <sudden6> nurupo: I don't think that's always true for all platforms
[21:25:27] <sudden6> I worked around it for now
[21:28:09] <nurupo> sudden6: char is guaranteed to be 1 byte in c++
[21:28:38] <sudden6> hmm, then it was probably c where that's not the case

[21:41:54] <nurupo> i'm a little confused about this myself. in C/C++ sizeof(char) is defined to always be 1 and that's what C/C++ calls a byte. it's not the byte that is always 8 bits, it's C's definition of a byte, the smallest addressable memory size, which might be more than 8 bits, e.g. 64-bit char would still have sizeof(char)==1, and sizeof(short), sizeof(int), sizoef(long), sizeof(long long) all would be 1 too in that case
