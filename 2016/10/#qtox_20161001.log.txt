[21:50:31] <sudden6> hi, everybody
[21:51:12] <initramfs> Hi
[21:51:35] <sudden6> initramfs: anything missing for https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3737 ?
[21:52:18] <initramfs> Let me take a look again
[21:56:49] <initramfs> I made another comment
[21:59:51] <sudden6> initramfs: commented
[22:03:12] <initramfs> sudden6: Responded
[22:03:33] <initramfs> This is so weird, we're talking indirectly when we have a direct channel of communications
[22:03:45] <sudden6> I exactly thought the same xD
[22:14:31] <sudden6> initramfs: done, and how are you btw? ;)
[22:14:53] <sudden6> (just so this communication channel isn't wasted) 
[22:14:58] <initramfs> Lol
[22:15:15] <initramfs> I'm good. My ISP broke IPv4 for me last week, got it back today
[22:15:20] <initramfs> So today is a good day
[22:15:20] <initramfs> Lol
[22:15:43] <sudden6> didn't you like IPv6? ^^
[22:16:09] <sudden6> I dread the day I have to remember the v6 address of my router config page...
[22:17:19] <initramfs> IPv6 was great
[22:17:24] <initramfs> I had access to
[22:17:30] <initramfs> 1%? of the internet
[22:17:55] <initramfs> Last weel was a TIL moment when GH doesn't support IPv6
[22:18:01] <sudden6> isn't there some backwards protocol like 6to4?
[22:18:17] <initramfs> Well, that's for carrying v6 over v4
[22:18:27] <initramfs> My v4 was broken, that'll just break all of the internet for me
[22:18:28] <sudden6> well, I'm not impressed of github
[22:18:54] <initramfs> lgtm btw
[22:18:55] <sudden6> ah, I thought there was somethting the other way round too
[22:19:38] <initramfs> There is ds-lite, but that requires ISP support
[22:20:11] <initramfs> ds-lite = Dual Stack Lite, allows transport of IPv4 over IPv6 to a AFTR router, which then routes the two separately
[22:21:07] <sudden6> I'll rebase the PR and then merge then :)
[22:21:10] <initramfs> Okay
[22:21:24] <sudden6> ok, I'm not familiar with IPv6 
[22:21:46] <sudden6> I was taken aback by my hoster asking me how many v6 addresses I wanted on my server
[22:22:00] <sudden6> I just assumed I'll only get one :DD
[22:22:40] <initramfs> Ah yes
[22:22:57] <initramfs> With 128-bits of addressing, they can be very liberal
[22:23:17] <initramfs> Well, technically they'll only give you down to a /48 block, but that's massive already
[22:24:26] <sudden6> hmm, my hoster seems to be a snowflake then, they said 10 addresses per user...
[22:24:41] <initramfs> Oh no, that's "normal"
[22:24:57] <sudden6> on the other hand it's a ~10€ per year hoster
[22:25:30] <initramfs> Whilst you could technically have 10^19 routable addresses, it doesn't mean the ISP is willing to route all of them
[22:25:58] <initramfs> So it's somewhat like picking phone numbers
[22:26:05] <sudden6> btw, I fixed a typo in the commit messages, I think you have to LGTM again, sorry
[22:26:11] <initramfs> Okay, no problem
[22:26:30] <sudden6> so it becomes a problem of the routing hardware then?
[22:27:27] <initramfs> I guess
[22:28:42] <sudden6> lets see when v6 gives access to more than 1% of the net :)
[22:28:43] <initramfs> Well, I'm no expert on IPv6, but I think there is a way to aggregate routing tables so it becomes irrelevant for them (i.e. their hardware won't matter), but I'm not sure
[22:29:28] <initramfs> Basically they forward all packets with a specific prefix to your router, then it becomes your router's responsibility to route all your billions of addresses
[22:29:52] <initramfs> The 10 host thing is probably legacy of the IPv4 days
[22:30:20] <initramfs> My ISP (in Taiwan) gives me 8 hosts/subscription but that's IPv4
[22:31:00] <sudden6> mhm, I see, so you're just announcing what subnet you're routing and all packets to that net are your responsibility
[22:31:07] <initramfs> Yep
[22:31:32] <initramfs> If you're wondering why the "smallest" address space they usually give is /64
[22:31:42] <sudden6> maybe their databases have only 10 columns for addresses, because it's enough for anyone ;P
[22:31:46] <initramfs> Lol
[22:32:15] <initramfs> It's because IPv6 addresses usually have a 64-bit host ID (which under stateless config, allows you to use your interface MAC address directly as the host ID)
[22:33:31] <initramfs> Technically their database only has to store the IPv6 prefix they gave you (i.e. xxxx:yyyy:zzzz::/48)
[22:33:47] <sudden6> mhm, but what happens with the 16bits not used by the mac?
[22:34:14] <initramfs> Oh, there is a conversion from 48-bit MAC addresses to 64-bit host IDs
[22:34:33] <sudden6> ? why a conversion? privacy reasons?
[22:34:48] <initramfs> Ehh, well that's more due to standards
[22:35:14] <initramfs> The conversion is: First 24-bits of MAC FFFE Last24-bits of mac
[22:35:45] <initramfs> So a MAC address of 00-00-00-00-00-00 will gain a host ID of: 0000:00FF:FE00:0000
[22:36:05] <sudden6> ok, no privacy, still doesn't really make sense
[22:36:23] <sudden6> why not do FFFE MAC
[22:38:46] <initramfs> Well, it's the format of the EUI-64 specifier
[22:38:58] <initramfs> You're technically doing a MAC->EUI-64 conversion
[22:39:02] <initramfs> Then using that as a host ID
[22:40:02] <initramfs> Since the first 24-bits of the MAC is the OUI, I guess they wanted to preserve it being first
[22:40:06] <sudden6> mhm, never heard of that before
[22:40:14] <sudden6> did tox work on ipv6 only?
[22:40:25] <initramfs> Ehh
[22:40:27] <initramfs> That was hard to say
[22:40:34] <initramfs> I was connected to the DHT apparently
[22:40:41] <initramfs> But some contacts were offline
[22:40:51] <initramfs> I was not sure if that was my issue or tox's issue
[22:41:22] <sudden6> some contacts offline would make sense, since it's a p2p connection, both must have the same protocol
[22:41:58] <sudden6> if you can't reach v4 internet, those contacts would be offline for you
[22:42:56] <sudden6> I'm currently wondering if the Tox DHT can store IPv4 and IPv6 for the same ToxID
[22:43:37] <zetok> sudden6: nope
[22:44:03] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] sudden6 pushed 3 new commits to master: https://git.io/vPqq5
[22:44:03] -qtox-git-spam- qTox/master ae76910 sudden6: feat(smileys): allow compiling qTox with minimal or no smileys...
[22:44:03] -qtox-git-spam- qTox/master 29da221 sudden6: feat(smileys): try to load smileys from XDG_DATA_DIR directories...
[22:44:03] -qtox-git-spam- qTox/master 6628bf2 sudden6: docs(smileys): mention emoji pack support and how to install them
[22:44:38] <sudden6> so a mixed group between v4 and v6 isn't possible atm?
[22:44:46] <initramfs> That's too bad
[22:45:19] <sudden6> I wonder if the bittorrent dht handles that
[22:46:19] <zetok> err?
[22:46:26] <zetok> >so a mixed group between v4 and v6 isn't possible atm?
[22:46:43] <zetok> it is?
[22:47:12] <zetok> it just needs 4→6 tunnelling
[22:47:16] <sudden6> ok? I'm interested in how it works then :)
[22:47:37] <zetok> and that's up to ISP
[22:47:42] <sudden6> yeah, I meant without such stuff
[22:47:50] <zetok> yeah, no
[22:47:52] <initramfs> Well... no then. a 4/6 group is not possible
[22:48:17] <initramfs> What you described is a all IPv4 group or a all IPv6 group from tox's perspective
[22:48:49] <initramfs> s/a all/an all/
[22:49:09] <zetok> well, ipv4 should just die
[22:51:01] <sudden6> if ipv4 would die a sudden death it would be Y2K, this time for real
[22:54:28] <initramfs> zetok: It would be more appropriate to massively speed up the adoption of IPv6
[22:55:09] <initramfs> GitHub for one... should offer IPv6 functionality... so I can actually work on stuff....
[23:04:18] <sudden6> zetok: do you think it would make sense to compile qTox on Travis only with min smileys?
[23:05:25] <initramfs> Is there a reduction in compile time?
[23:05:39] <sudden6> let me check
[23:06:02] <sudden6> at least a reduction in memory usage, last time I checked
[23:10:18] <sudden6> would be cool if travis used gcc6, it's noticeably faster :)
[23:11:39] <initramfs> Yes
[23:12:09] <initramfs> I can compile qTox in 50 seconds on my local machine using clang lol
[23:12:24] <sudden6> from a clean dir? :O
[23:12:28] <initramfs> Yep
[23:12:32] <initramfs> And no ccache
[23:12:37] <sudden6> what beast do you have under your desk?
[23:12:44] <initramfs> Well, it's a laptop
[23:13:20] <initramfs> It's more about disk I/O than CPU
[23:13:59] <sudden6> I think for me it's cpu bound
[23:14:14] <sudden6>         User time (seconds): 230.78
[23:14:16] <sudden6>         System time (seconds): 24.23
[23:14:23] <sudden6> with all smileys
[23:14:42] <initramfs> I see
[23:14:56] <sudden6> Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 405612
[23:17:08] <sudden6> how do you compile qtox with clang? (on linux)
[23:17:12] <iphy> it takes about 7 seconds just to generate the translations (which is a linear process here)
[23:17:29] <initramfs> real0m50.189s
[23:17:38] <initramfs> user6m4.827s
[23:17:52] <initramfs> sys0m12.970s
[23:17:58] <sudden6> initramfs: use /usr/bin/time -v make gives nice stats :)
[23:18:06] <initramfs> Sure
[23:19:19] <iphy> building qtox without resources: 36 seconds (including generating translations)
[23:19:26] <iphy> with resources: 51 seconds
[23:19:42] <iphy> including linking twice (once qtox and once the test program)
[23:20:20] <sudden6>         User time (seconds): 232.70
[23:20:21] <sudden6>         System time (seconds): 24.21
[23:20:32] <sudden6> hmm, doesn't seem to make much difference on my pc
[23:21:10] <iphy> compiling resources cpp takes 2 seconds, compiling translations resources (cpp) takes 2 seconds, smileys takes 10 seconds
[23:21:20] <iphy> compiling the smileys cpp file with clang

[23:27:42] <sudden6> I think I'll just try a pr and see if it's faster lol
[23:30:57] <initramfs> Lol, min smileys is faster than no smileys: 49s vs 46s
[23:31:08] <initramfs> But it's just one run so that's not accurate
[23:31:27] <initramfs> Sorry I meant 46s vs 49s (min vs no, respectively)
[23:35:20] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] sudden6 opened pull request #3763: [TEST]feat(travis): speedup build (master...speedup_travis) https://git.io/vPqOW
[23:35:32] <sudden6> I just opened a PR to test if it makes a significant difference
[23:35:47] <sudden6> I also upped the number of threads
[23:37:36] <sudden6> prev time was ~25min
[23:39:01] <initramfs> I think it was downed at one point because travis was failing, but I don't know if that's still relevant
[23:39:20] <sudden6> yeah, there's an annotation about that
[23:40:10] <sudden6> but we reduced RAM usage significantly one time by enabling maximum resource compression
[23:40:47] <sudden6> nobody even noticed the build needing more than >1G of RAM until Diadlo complained^^
[23:41:00] <initramfs> The xcode version PR also bumped resources allocated to the OSX builds
[23:42:56] <sudden6> hmm, I just found we could compile ffmpeg without most of the stuff
[23:44:50] <iphy> sudden6: it's all the PRs in the toktok org
[23:45:27] <iphy> sudden6: I wrote a tool to show an overview like that
[23:45:42] <sudden6> nice, what language? :)
[23:45:42] <iphy> https://github.com/iphydf/pull-status
[23:45:48] <iphy> take a wild guess
[23:46:10] <sudden6> well seems like you expected my question ^^
[23:46:39] <iphy> + means approved
[23:47:06] <iphy> - means changes required, nothing means no response yet, but in the assignees list
[23:47:53] <initramfs> iphy: Do you know racket?
[23:48:03] <iphy> yes
[23:48:23] <initramfs> How long do you recon one can learn haskell given prior knowledge of racket
[23:49:25] <iphy> 2 weeks
[23:57:46] <Diadlo> sudden6: could someone of you test with git master and "qmake SMILEYS=NO" and "qmake SMILEYS=MIN" <- Do you mean time of qmake or time of make? Or test build at all? :)
[23:58:17] <sudden6> Diadlo: I already made a PR to travis, didn't make much difference...
[23:58:30] <sudden6> I'm now looking into reducing ffmpeg build
