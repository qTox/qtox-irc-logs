[10:59:00] <Neolex> Hi
[10:59:08] <iphy> hi
[11:00:23] <Neolex> Diadlo: are you there ?
[11:02:00] <Neolex> for my PR , I don't understand ,the number can't be lower than 1024 so how alert the user if it's lower ?
[11:18:11] <Diadlo> Neolex: Hello. Yes. I am there
[11:18:25] <Diadlo> You can use GUI class
[11:18:59] <Diadlo> Something like GUI::showWarning
[11:19:42] <Neolex> and I connect it to the signal valueChanged ?
[11:20:47] <Diadlo> Wait a sec
[11:20:51] <Neolex> ah non , in the valuechanged slot
[11:22:39] <Diadlo> In Settings::setStartUDPPort you have `if` which check port correctnes
[11:22:59] <Neolex> but i dont think the port could be incorrect
[11:22:59] <Diadlo> Add `else { GUI::showWarnong("text"); }
[11:23:38] <Diadlo> Why?
[11:23:39] <Neolex> I have set the mini and maxi port in the form
[11:24:05] <Neolex> the spinbox number have to be between 1024 and 65535 
[11:24:17] <Diadlo> Oh...
[11:25:53] <Diadlo> Better ask initramfs
[11:26:01] <Neolex> ok
[11:26:03] <Neolex> thank you
[11:26:40] <Diadlo> Anyway, you can remove spinbox min and max values and use `if` validation
[11:27:33] <Neolex> ok
