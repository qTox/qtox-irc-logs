[00:13:37] <SkyzohKey> I'm rewriting it in local for now in order to add 1 section per feature with images, swagg and content
[00:13:45] <SkyzohKey> cuz currently it doesn't helps that much
[00:14:07] <iphy> SkyzohKey: yes
[00:14:15] <iphy> my browser doesn't really like it though
[00:14:18] <iphy> pretty slow
[00:14:19] <SkyzohKey> ah ?
[00:14:21] <SkyzohKey> o.o
[00:14:22] <SkyzohKey> wtf
[00:14:31] <SkyzohKey> it takes only 260 ms to fully load here
[00:14:56] <SkyzohKey> I like the mockups :o
[00:15:00] <SkyzohKey> who did them ?
[00:48:50] <SkyzohKey> iphy; did u wrote this ? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Reo3BcB0dAXcB2LhcmTAPUUpUf9eOHCL_6s6FS_1-sY/edit
[00:57:07] <iphy> SkyzohKey: no, my gsoc student did that
[00:57:10] <iphy> Andre Almeida
[00:57:13] <SkyzohKey> nice
[01:01:26] <iphy> SkyzohKey: he made a pretty nice android UI
[01:01:36] <SkyzohKey> yeah saw that
[01:01:39] <iphy> it doesn't work anymore because google updated their libraries
[01:01:42] <SkyzohKey> x:

[05:46:47] <kdhp> Hello.
[05:47:17] <oranges> hi
[05:50:09] <kdhp> I found that qTox inadvertently relies on the deinitialization order of a static variable, which can cause a conflict with OpenAL-Soft (Audio::getInstance())

[20:42:27] <zetok> :3
[20:43:21] <Diadlo> *facepalm*
[20:43:58] <Diadlo> Ok. What behaviour you expect?
[20:44:05] <zetok> dunno
[20:44:19] <Diadlo> :|
[20:44:30] <zetok> we probably should put some restrictions in place
[20:44:55] <zetok> i.e. no newlines, limit input size to something like 128 chars
[20:45:01] <Diadlo> Ok
[20:46:09] <Diadlo> zetok: What about `\t`?
[20:46:56] <zetok> can 128 `\t` break UI?
[20:48:42] <zetok> just checked, they can't
[20:48:50] <zetok> so it's not a problem :)
[20:56:21] <Diadlo> zetok: Done
[20:59:11] <zetok> now qTox doesn't start
[20:59:25] <zetok> I just get the warning `Format shouldn't contains newlines and be bigger than 128`
[21:00:48] <Diadlo> zetok: Will be normal completely reset format?
[21:01:09] <zetok> um, could there be just a limit on the input field, instead of showing a warning?
[21:01:20] <Diadlo> Whatabout new lines?
[21:01:41] <zetok> oh, input field can't be limited like that?
[21:02:00] <Diadlo> I'll check
[21:02:00] <zetok> as for bad settings format – I guess
[21:02:26] <zetok> but only if format in stored settings is invalid
[21:03:38] <Diadlo> So what we should do, if invalid format stored in settings?
[21:03:56] <Diadlo> Reset to one of default?
[21:04:21] <zetok> yep

[21:49:39] <sudden6> Diadlo: I can see no fix in https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3791 ? could you explain? the code looks like it does the same as before to me
[21:50:08] <Diadlo> I remove `+1` from index
[21:50:12] <Diadlo> It was wrond
[21:50:27] <Diadlo> We found element in list and take index + 1
[21:50:41] <sudden6> ah, thx I get it now :)
[21:51:19] <Diadlo> Np
[21:52:12] <Diadlo> sudden6: I need you help
[21:53:24] <sudden6> ok :)
[21:53:31] <sudden6> Diadlo: where?  :)
[21:54:05] <Diadlo> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3714#issuecomment-246987436 <--- Here antis81 said, that +1 is needed. Is he wrong?
[21:55:25] <sudden6> ok wait
[21:56:18] <Diadlo> Or better ask antis81?)
[21:58:05] <sudden6> Diadlo: I don't think antis81 is wrong here
[21:58:17] <sudden6> or wait again^^
[21:58:20] <Diadlo> Why?)
[21:58:22] <Diadlo> Ok))
[22:00:41] <Diadlo> What I can see: I have 2 devices. "Disabled" and "Real Device". indexOf("Real Device") return `1`. And if I try setup last device I have white field when go away from tab and return back
[22:01:21] <sudden6> Diadlo: yep, I think you are right
[22:01:34] <Diadlo> Thanks)
[22:01:54] <sudden6> the code sets the index one field wrong
[22:06:50] <sudden6> Diadlo: your code sets the input device to the first available one, wouldn't it be better to set it to disabled?
[22:07:04] <sudden6> zetok: ↑ what do you think about that?
[22:07:51] <Diadlo> sudden6: It's not part of my PR
[22:08:07] <sudden6> hmm, true
[22:08:17] <sudden6> still what do you think about it generally?
[22:09:16] <Diadlo> I think anyone better than "Disabled" by default
[22:09:32] <Diadlo> *anything
[22:10:49] <Diadlo> When you start av-chat application first time, what behaviors do you expect? Disabled audio? I don't think so :)
[22:12:56] <sudden6> hmm, I had the argument of "don't turn on possibly unwanted datasources by default" in mind, but I think that's more my preference
[22:13:52] <zetok> sudden6: no
[22:14:23] <Diadlo> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3714#issuecomment-246721425 <-- Also antis81 opinion
