[09:51:35] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] sudden6 closed pull request #3827: use a dynamic salt for the database password (master...dynamic_salt) https://git.io/vPNLV
[10:12:29] <iphy> Diadlo, sudd3n6: I would indeed suggest reverting the code changes in the cmake PR
[10:12:52] *** sudd3n6 is now known as sudden6
[10:12:56] <sudden6> ok
[10:13:09] <sudden6> maybe comment to the PR?
[10:15:10] <iphy> you've already commented that
[10:15:17] <iphy> I just agree

[12:48:04] <iphy> zetok: ^ that's just bad usability
[12:48:11] <iphy> docs don't fix bad usability
[12:48:26] <zetok> right
[12:48:28] <iphy> (but they help users get along with it)
[12:48:44] <zetok> what would be the right way to do it?
[12:48:49] <iphy> no idea
[12:48:54] <iphy> do usability engineering
[12:49:10] <iphy> like andrealmieda did for the toktok client
[12:52:39] <zetok> :(
[12:53:45] <iphy> if I ever get around to it, I'll do that for qtox
[12:53:54] <iphy> or I can guide someone who wants to do it
[12:54:05] <iphy> (more likely)

[15:48:49] <Emcy_> is there a way to point the autoupdater of qtox nightly to the nightly package on build.tox.chat
[15:49:43] <Emcy_> i think it comes with the same updater as stable/release to it never really updates if you use qtox nightly
[15:56:30] <zetok> nope
[16:02:59] <Emcy_> its not possible or you wont do it
