[12:26:39] <tux3> mva, qTox uses the toxme.io API, instead of the old ToxDNS api, you can find some documentation here: https://github.com/LittleVulpix/toxme/blob/master/doc/api.md
[12:28:50] <tux3> SkyzohKey, we use OpenAL and FFMpeg with some platform-specific APIs (v4l2, DirectShow, AVFoundation)

[12:44:21] <mva> uhm
[12:44:25] <mva> strange thing
[12:45:30] <mva> I installed (updated, actually) qtox on children laptop. And now it starts fine if I run it over ssh (DISPLAY=:0 qtox), but if I run it locally on it - it segfaults after entering profile password :(

[12:50:10] <mva> but, as I said, it doesn't segfault if I run it (on the same display with the same user) with ssh
[12:50:34] <mva> so, it is doubtful, it is Qt fault (as can be seen from backtrace) 
[12:50:49] <sudden6> looks like problems with the systray
[12:51:16] <sudden6> systray isn't well supported on older versions of qt
[12:52:03] <sudden6> is the DISPLAY envvar set if you run it locally?
[12:52:43] <SkyzohKey> mva: quick fix: edit the .desktop file to add Exec=DISPLAY=:0 qTox c:
[12:55:12] <tux3> mva, if you're using KDE, it seems to be a known bug: https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/3168

[17:34:58] <mva> btw
[17:35:07] <mva>  @tux3 │ mva, qTox uses the toxme.io API, instead of the old ToxDNS api, you can find some documentation here: https://github.com/LittleVulpix/toxme/blob/master/doc/api.md

[17:36:05] <mva> but in real world it sends some requests like "GET /pk HTTP/1.1" 
[17:36:56] <tux3> mva, there are two URLs, /pk to get the server's public key, and /api for the toxme JSON requests

[22:24:24] <Diadlo> Should we merge #3865 as little improvement of #3861?
[22:24:38] <Diadlo> (I will remove `Fix #3861` from commit message)
[22:24:56] <sudden6> Diadlo: It doesn't really change anything for me
[22:25:11] <sudden6> ie no behaviour change
[22:25:18] <Diadlo> But for me -- does. Issue depend of DPI
[22:25:26] <sudden6> is grid layout the wrong one?
[22:25:45] <Diadlo> A bit
[22:26:25] <sudden6> I have nothing against it, it doesn't cause any regressions for me
[22:26:56] <sudden6> I'll LGTM
[22:28:11] <Diadlo> 1) We use form layout everywhere (so, consisting) 2) `grid` has different alignment with `form`, so this block look different
[22:28:24] <zetok> err
[22:28:27] <zetok> it doesn't fix the issue
[22:28:28] <Diadlo> And grid wider
[22:28:30] <Diadlo> *is
[22:28:37] <Diadlo> zetok: [01:24] <Diadlo> (I will remove `Fix #3861` from commit message)
[22:29:00] <zetok> ok
[22:29:44] <sudden6> I'll merge the warnings fix now, won't have time till sunday probably
[22:29:47] <zetok> perhaps change that to `Improves #`
[22:30:32] <Diadlo> zetok: Why we use --ff-only ?

[22:38:01] <zetok> yes
[22:38:05] <Diadlo> Why?
[22:38:27] <zetok> because there would be no good branch names
[22:38:58] <Diadlo> It still will seen as one logical block
[22:39:20] <zetok> if you want, I'll just use random branch names, literally `dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=1 | sha..`
[22:39:31] <Diadlo> [01:38] <Diadlo> It still will seen as one logical block
[22:39:43] <Diadlo> Without branch names
[22:40:07] <zetok> yeah, you don't get that either, given that not all PRs can be fast forwarded
[22:41:54] <Diadlo> I talk about no-ff

[22:42:27] <Diadlo> Not all PRs can be rebased
[22:42:29] <Diadlo> Yes

[22:43:38] <Diadlo> If user didn't sign his commits, why we didn't rebase it?

[22:46:33] <Diadlo> First of all, do you agree, that no-ff picture looks better? (forget about qtox now)
[22:47:17] <zetok> not really
[22:47:37] <Diadlo> Why?
[22:48:50] <zetok> it introduces unnecessary merge commits
[22:49:23] <Diadlo> Oh my god! One more commit!
[22:49:47] <zetok> thousands you mean
[22:50:53] <zetok> well, something to think about
[22:51:08] <Diadlo> Why amount of commits is matter?
[22:55:20] <zetok> the more useless commits you have, the less useful git log is
[22:55:58] <zetok> and unnecessary merge commit makes a case for unnecessary commits in PRs
[22:59:59] <Diadlo> > the more useless commits you have, the less useful git log is < Not. Logical block are helpful for regression test. If you found commit were regression start, reason of regression not beyond of block
[23:00:11] <Diadlo> and unnecessary merge commit makes a case for unnecessary commits in PRs < Hm... No?
