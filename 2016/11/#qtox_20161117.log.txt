[10:30:33] <piaert> Where can I download qTox 1.6.0 for Windows?
[10:31:17] <zetok> from download links
[10:31:33] <zetok> if you have 1.5.2 installed, it should update itself
[10:32:36] <zetok> piaert: https://github.com/qTox/qTox#qtox ?
[10:34:58] <piaert> let me try downloading it again then
[10:43:02] <SkyzohKey> zetok: feel free to move the file in res if u' want c:
[10:45:24] <piaert> zetok: thank you, the file now points to 1.6.0, it did not yesterday
[10:45:52] <zetok> piaert: yeah, it was updated :)

[10:58:21] *** Joins: ceurer (68eea994@ )
[10:59:06] <qtoxuser> I have a little question about qtox 1.6, someone can lend me a hand
[10:59:42] <zetok> sure
[11:00:37] <ceurer> Is there a way of increasing the size of text in the text input box? The one that says "Type your message here...".
[11:00:45] <ceurer> It is very hard for me to see what I type
[11:01:04] <ceurer> I have already increased the other text size
[11:01:05] <qtoxuser> From where I can download the new version for debianya that in the new repositories does not appear to me
[11:01:29] <zetok> qtoxuser: it'll be available once the maintainer has the time to update
[11:01:54] <zetok> ceurer: not yet, unless you don't mind playing with source
[11:02:57] <qtoxuser> Thank you for your answer, then wait;)
[11:03:08] <ceurer> zetok: thank you for the info. I can't deal with source.
[11:03:18] <ceurer> the text is just too small on a 4K monitor
[11:03:19] <zetok> ceurer: um, it wouldn't be hard
[11:03:32] <zetok> (unless you're on windows, there compiling qTox sucks)
[11:03:39] <ceurer> yes I am on Windows
[11:03:45] <zetok> oh

[18:33:47] <Emcy> if you enable portable mode in qtox
[18:34:19] <Emcy> does it automatically copy or move the stuff in appdata [or usr] to its own directory
[18:34:32] <Emcy> i mean the directory its running from
[18:34:41] <Emcy> or do you have to move it yourself
[18:34:48] <zetok> it should
[18:37:49] <Emcy> ok
[18:37:53] <Emcy> i will test this

[19:33:31] <Diadlo> zetok: What you mean by `Tox ID` aren't accessible?
[19:33:40] <Diadlo> *do you
[19:33:47] <zetok> Diadlo: are they?
[19:33:58] <zetok> i.e. how does one copy them?
[19:34:26] <Diadlo> Click Tab until it will be selected, Ctrl + C
[19:34:33] <Diadlo> I didn't try
[19:34:54] <Diadlo> Tested. It works
[19:35:33] <Diadlo> And screen reader can read it
[19:38:00] <zetok> ok, nvm then
[19:38:30] <Emcy> is qtox in portable mode able to properly autoupdate itself
[20:07:32] *** Joins: sudden6 (~anonymous@ )
[20:23:59] <Emcy> ok so enabling portable mode just copied the .tox from appdata on windows
[20:24:15] <Emcy> it did not delete what was left behind
[20:24:33] <Emcy> also, even in portable mode it creates an empty tox folder back in appdata
[20:25:08] <Emcy> kinda not as covert as i had hoped

[21:26:29] <zetok> abbat: ↑ ?
[21:29:59] <abbat> zetok, Have to re-install or update repo key from OBS
[21:31:29] <zetok> right
[21:31:39] <zetok> is there a command for it?
[21:31:54] <zetok> (updating repo key)
[21:34:10] <abbat> May be zypper --gpg-auto-import-keys ref (I'm not sure)
[21:34:49] <zetok> ok
[21:34:58] <zetok> I guess it'll be simpler to remove & add repo again
[22:17:20] <zetok> abbat: btw, there were some people asking about for 1.6 in OBS
[22:22:29] <abbat> zetok, In progress right now

[22:26:00] <Asal> Hi there!
[22:26:06] <Asal> I have a qestion
[22:26:28] <Asal> how I do to compile qTox in OpenBSD?
[22:27:31] <Asal> What are the requeriments, because the needed packages for GNU/Linux can have a different name for OpenBSD
[22:27:53] <Asal> Should I use gmake to compile?
[22:28:16] <Asal> well, there are my questions, when you have time, please answer... Thank you all!
[22:29:16] <zetok> Asal: have you looked at the INSTALL.md ?
[22:30:16] <zetok> Asal: there's a list of dependencies there, but aside from that I'm not sure how relevant to OpenBSD it is
[22:30:35] <zetok> it would be good to add OpenBSD section :)
[22:30:50] <Asal> OK, I will start from there! I think I had, but I don't remember! 
[22:31:07] <Asal> Yes, It would be nice to have a section for OpenBSD
[22:31:36] <Asal> wait just a few minutes, let's see what I can have in the INSTALL.md
[22:37:03] <Asal> mmm... I just see a problem here... there is not a clear instruction about dependencies in OpenBSD
[22:37:05] <Asal> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/INSTALL.md
[22:37:41] <Asal> in FreeBSD you have the ports, so, when you try "make install clean" dependencies are bulding, and installed automatically
[22:38:17] <Asal> but, the deal here is that the package names of dependences could be different in OpenBSD
[22:48:37] <sudden6> Asal: I guess the package names are similar to Linux, you'll probably have to take some educated guesses
[22:49:12] <sudden6> but if you found out all dependencies for OpenBSD it would be cool if you could at them to INSTALL.md
[22:50:37] <sudden6> you could probably ask on an OpenBSD channel for help on locating the correct packages
