[00:12:19] <nurupo> ><zetok> drawings are usually full of useful info <-- drawing a thing and sending it as an image is a nice feature. some collaborative live drawing using tox custom packets might be a useful feature too
[00:12:36] <zetok> one thing at a time
[00:13:10] <zetok> feature request was to do one-way drawing pic, which should be simple to implement
[00:14:22] <zetok> as for using custom packets, that's not really compelling
[00:17:06] <zetok> hm.
[00:20:12] <nurupo> ><iphy> Does Qt facilitate good resource management practices? <-- if be "resource" you mean memory, Qt uses child-parent relation where the container owns the items. in Qt you use raw pointers, like `QWidget *w = new QWidget();`, then you add that QWidget* to some QLayout* of some other QWidget*, and that other QWidget* might be set as QMainWindow::centralWidget(), so that whenever the QMainWindow gets destroyed, it destroys its children.
[00:21:03] <iphy> resource, window, file, anything
[00:21:16] <nurupo> using raw pointers like that is a bit weird if you come from C++11 background where you never use raw pointers and wrap everything into unique and shared pointer RIIA
[00:21:32] <nurupo> *RAII
[00:26:40] <nurupo> ><iphy> Do you have a policy about calling static member functions through pointers? <-- why would you ever call static member functions throught pointers? D: it's so confusing, it might make you think the output depends on the object and/or that the function modifies internal state of the object. just do `MyClass::static_function();`
[00:26:52] <iphy> nurupo: exactly
[00:26:57] <iphy> nurupo: but qtox does :)
[00:27:14] <nurupo> crazy
[00:29:38] <iphy> nurupo: it even possibly instantiates the object just to then not use it and call a static member function on it
[00:29:50] <nurupo> ><iphy> Even to the point where it works really hard to get a pointer <-- lol

[09:05:23] <zetok> Diadlo: which milestone?
[09:05:32] <Diadlo> Version
[09:05:43] <zetok> um?
[09:05:47] <zetok> but where would it fit?
[09:06:28] <Diadlo> v1.6.0 / v1.7.0 / v1.8.0
[09:06:29] <Diadlo> We have unimplemented tox feature
[09:06:41] <Diadlo> I think, it should be implemented
[09:06:55] <Diadlo> Isn't it?
[09:07:06] <zetok> which feature?
[09:07:25] <zetok> FTs are one thing

[09:07:59] <zetok> oh, right
[09:08:07] <zetok> sorry, I just brainfarted
[09:08:13] <Diadlo> Np :)
[09:08:45] <zetok> I don't think that this is important enough
[09:08:57] <Diadlo> Or
[09:09:00] <Diadlo> *Ok
[09:09:49] <zetok> i.e. milestone stuff is supposed to be important, and should be possible to be done in given time period
[09:10:23] <zetok> versions milestones that is
[09:11:05] <zetok> the way I see it, it either could be added to https://github.com/qTox/qTox/milestone/10 , or it depends on it
[09:11:55] <Diadlo> Good idea

[16:54:02] <zetok> FX: https://www.soimort.org/translate-shell/
[16:54:49] <sudden6> basically follow https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/INSTALL.md#install-git until https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/INSTALL.md#compile-qtox there you can just go in your local qTox git repository and open the qTox.pro file with qtcreator

[22:53:23] <sudden6> Hi Diadlo :) did he take over?
[22:53:38] <Diadlo> IDK
[22:54:00] <sudden6> ah, ok
[23:02:14] <Diadlo> zetok: Why you use $@ instead of $1 ?
[23:04:13] <zetok> consistency
[23:04:28] <zetok> no actual reason
[23:04:30] <Diadlo> Ok
[23:06:34] <zetok> um, that's in this script
[23:06:50] <zetok> in other scripts there might have been reasons
[23:07:02] <Diadlo> Why $COMMIT_MSG != "feat(l10n): update .* translation from Weblate" ?
[23:07:45] <zetok> um?
[23:08:12] <Diadlo> I.e. you amend commit with `feat(l10n)` message. But create new commit with `chore(i18n)`
[23:08:26] <zetok> oh
[23:08:34] <zetok> different stuff
[23:08:47] <zetok> new commit is for updating translations for Weblate
[23:09:07] <zetok> while what gets amended, is commit pulled from Weblate that needs cleaning
[23:09:34] <Diadlo> It seems strange behaviour for this script
[23:09:57] <Diadlo> But if you think, this it's right -- say it and I will LGTM
[23:10:18] <zetok> um, I'm not sure about the design of this
[23:10:29] <zetok> actually, it needs further refactoring
[23:10:42] <zetok> but I'm lazy, and it already works
[23:11:04] <zetok> so until there'll be an actual reason to bother with refactoring, it looks good enough to me
[23:11:45] <Diadlo> AFAIK, before this PR it has different behaviour. Isn't it?
[23:11:50] <Diadlo> Without amend
[23:11:53] <zetok> yep
[23:12:21] <Diadlo> So you add non-obvious behaviour :)
[23:12:51] <Diadlo> But ok. Mostly you are update translation :)
[23:13:40] <zetok> actually, I just thought of a way to make it better
[23:13:51] <zetok> wrap "original" script in another script
[23:13:58] <zetok> how does that sound?
[23:14:35] <Diadlo> Normal
[23:15:32] <Diadlo> ly
[23:15:59] <zetok> um, better/worse than what PR has?
[23:16:14] <Diadlo> IMO, better
[23:16:28] <zetok> ok, going to change it then
[23:16:32] <Diadlo> 2 scripts = 2 behaviour
[23:16:37] <zetok> probably not today though
