[12:06:50] <sudden6> have also felt better
[12:09:37] <Diadlo> Do you know, why reviewable dtop LGTM on rebase?
[12:09:42] <Diadlo> *drop
[12:09:50] <sudden6> nope
[12:10:27] <sudden6> but zetok told me, if one doesn't leave comment or reviews a file, reviewable doesn't save the state to it's db
[12:10:40] <sudden6> and forgets stuff over a rebase
[12:11:18] <zetok> initramfs' comment should have made it work in that case
[12:12:33] <zetok> the other case where LGTM is dropped during rebase is when PR changes touch same files that were changed in rebase
[12:13:32] <Diadlo> Yes. It's logical

[12:15:01] <iphy> :lgtm_strong: avoids the problem

[21:15:59] <initramfs> Swap the declaration order in profile.h
[21:18:31] <sudden6> Interesting
[21:18:49] <sudden6> didn't think the order matters in C++ O_o
[21:19:21] <sudden6> fixed
[21:19:43] <initramfs> Well, it does, since members are initialized in declaration order (rather than the order you specified in the member initialization list)
[21:20:05] <initramfs> So had you accidentally used a member before it was initialized, the compiler warns you about it
[21:20:58] <sudden6> ah, I just assumed you can't use other members in the initialization list
[21:22:43] <initramfs> Well, that would be somewhat tragic. If an initialization operation depended on other member variables, well... good luck getting it initialized.
[21:23:24] <sudden6> mhm, I would have initialized it in the constructor :)
[21:23:42] <initramfs> And "initializing" it in the constructor body is not correct. That's technically initialization followed by copy assignment
[21:24:01] <sudden6> that would have been my next question^^
[21:24:12] <sudden6> I thought they were the same
[21:24:17] <initramfs> Nope
[21:24:25] <initramfs> One uses operator=
[21:24:34] <initramfs> The other invokes the constructor
[21:25:05] <sudden6> C++ is a lot more complex in the details than any other language I know^^
[21:25:11] <initramfs> Yeah
[21:25:14] <initramfs> Some objects are explicitly not assignable
[21:26:30] <sudden6> do you think loading the database asynchronously will be a problem in qTox?
[21:26:36] <sudden6> ie race conditions?
[21:26:58] <initramfs> Well, race conditions are only relevant when multiple threads are involved
[21:27:10] <sudden6> they are
[21:27:16] <sudden6> I think
[21:27:20] <sudden6> yes
[21:27:54] <initramfs> Well, I see that your code uses the Qt signal-slot mechanism which basically handles synchronization for you
[21:28:08] <sudden6> I meant logic race conditions
[21:28:34] <sudden6> something accessing history before db is loaded for example
[21:28:47] <initramfs> Well, I'm not sure if that's a term. But in any case, code should be in place to handle that.
[21:29:03] <initramfs> Or at the very least, documentation should be written to forbid such patterns
[21:29:45] <initramfs> In essence, if a object has functions foo() and bar() and the documentation says nothing, I am to assume that foo() and bar() can be called in any order any number of times
[21:30:10] <sudden6> yep
[21:30:10] <initramfs> Making the db load asynchronously hasn't done anything to change that
[21:30:55] <zetok> could someone ping me when it'll be ready for testing?
[21:31:03] <initramfs> Sure

[23:12:17] <zetok> (and old format of data)
[23:12:17] <sudden6> seems to be the case
[23:12:23] <zetok> hm.
[23:12:36] <initramfs> Lol
[23:12:38] <initramfs> Now this is getting stupid
[23:12:49] <initramfs> Are we chain upgrading DB formats?
[23:12:52] <zetok> ok, another piece of data lost
[23:12:56] <zetok> :c
[23:13:13] <zetok> initramfs: kinda
[23:13:21] <initramfs> Urg
[23:13:22] <sudden6> initramfs: zetok no
[23:13:37] <sudden6> just change the way the encryption key is generated
[23:13:52] <zetok> TES encrypted → sqlcipher encrypted → some DB format change → data lost, I think
[23:14:21] <zetok> sudden6: ok, I'm going to try with my other encrypted profiles
[23:15:15] <zetok> no, wait
[23:15:33] <zetok> master didn't seem to have any problems with openening this DB
[23:15:39] <zetok> or at least it didn't print anything
[23:16:24] <zetok> [23:16:07.163 UTC] persistence/db/rawdatabase.cpp:566 : Warning: Failed to prepare statement "SELECT count(*) FROM sqlite_master" with error 26
[23:16:24] <zetok> [23:16:07.163 UTC] persistence/db/rawdatabase.cpp:175 : Warning: Database is unusable, check that the password is correct
[23:16:33] <zetok> yeah, it's reproducible across all profiles
[23:17:37] <zetok> >qTox couldn't open your history, it'll be turned off
[23:17:47] <zetok> great, just what I needed when creating a new profile
[23:18:21] <initramfs> zetok: For all "old" profiles, you should get at least one set of those warnings
[23:18:26] <zetok> https://gist.github.com/zetok/60e4b73273443bb25a9beada9eac75e7 ← new profile
[23:18:45] <zetok> initramfs: I prefer to "catch 'em all"
[23:19:37] <initramfs> zetok: No, because we don't have a way to test whether someone is using the old static salt or not, we attempt to open the database with PK salt first, falling back to the static salt
[23:19:49] <zetok> k
[23:19:57] <initramfs> So for all "old" profiles, you'll see at least one open failure
[23:20:14] <zetok> anyway, found better stuff :3
[23:21:28] <sudden6> zetok: strange thing, when creating a new profile it shows errors, but works...
[23:21:51] <sudden6> errors -> warnings
[23:23:08] <sudden6> anyway, I have to sleep now...
[23:23:14] <sudden6> see you tomorrow?
[23:23:33] <zetok> sudden6: bai, I've posted a crash I've found
[23:23:42] <zetok> sleep well :3
[23:23:45] <initramfs> Night
[23:24:30] <sudden6> zetok: are you sure that doesn't happen on master?
[23:24:37] <zetok> no idea
[23:24:59] <sudden6> pls check, night
[23:26:31] <zetok> oh, great, master segfaults without anything
[23:26:44] <zetok> your PR actually fixes the segfault
[23:26:56] <zetok> and makes it a race condition
[23:28:41] <initramfs> zetok: I'll investigate, I think I know what went wrong
[23:28:49] <zetok> I guess it's the time to flip the switch for testing week?
[23:29:33] <zetok> https://gist.github.com/zetok/58a94354ae91116ce7e1927f2be6fdee ← bt from master segfault

[23:31:16] <initramfs> Huh fun... I got a different segfault..
