[19:11:25] <cisc> On https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:antonbatenev:tox/qtox filename is qtox_201610292107~v1.5.1.tar.bz2 but on the about page in qTox it says v1.5.2-obs, so I guess the about page is wrong?
[19:16:41] <zetok> yes and no
[19:17:04] <zetok> tag v1.5.2 points to the same commit as v1.5.1

[19:48:16] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] tux3 closed pull request #3847: fix(build): Avoid 64bit atomics for compatibility (master...atomic-32bit-build-fix) https://git.io/vXmRE
[20:02:17] <cisc> but it's really 1.5.2?
[20:02:47] <zetok> 1.5.2 == 1.5.1
[20:03:50] <zetok> it's just a difference between what was checked out, and what git shows with `describe`
[20:04:37] <cisc> so if the OBS package is being updated like it was 3 days ago, that's not getting the latest commits for qTox or it is?
[20:05:07] <zetok> it's getting the version it says it's getting
[20:05:17] <zetok> for ~latest master use qtox-alpha
[20:05:25] <zetok> (that probably should be written somewhere)
[20:06:18] <zetok> >so if the OBS package is being updated like it was 3 days ago
[20:06:26] <cisc> so why does qTox say 1.5.2 when it's 1.5.1, just a misprint?
[20:06:32] <zetok> dependencies in distro were bumped and it was needed to be recompiled
[20:06:44] <cisc> yes I figured that
[20:07:04] <zetok> no, windows needed a special release because m$ broke their OS
[20:07:10] <cisc> oh great
[20:09:26] <zetok> nothing in qTox has changed, but bundled ffmpged was bumped & patched
[20:12:03] <cisc> so the Windows version on the about page says 1.5.2 even though it's @ 1.5.1?
[20:12:18] <cisc> I'm looking at https://github.com/qTox/qTox/releases
[20:12:30] <zetok> ~yep
[20:16:54] <cisc> what was the issue?
[20:17:07] <zetok> crashing with video
[20:17:28] <oranges> with no survivors
[20:17:46] <zetok> ↑
[20:17:48] <zetok> cisc: https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3612
[20:17:58] <cisc> so that couldn't be patched in qtox yet leaving the version in the about page @ 1.5.1?
[20:18:37] <zetok> ffmpeg was bumped 2.8 → 3.1 + patches that didn't land on master then, that could have had some regressions
[20:21:40] <cisc> i see
[20:21:59] <cisc> so it's qtox 1.5.1.1
[20:22:37] <zetok> yes, but people don't like 4 digits
[20:22:40] <zetok> :f
[20:24:11] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] zetok opened pull request #3848: docs(INSTALL): inform users about `qtox-alpha` package (master...docs-install-alpha) https://git.io/vX3Ys
[20:26:38] <cisc> zetok: so technically v1.5.2 is not released yet, correct?
[20:26:44] <zetok> it has been
[20:27:04] *** Joins: abbat (~Anton@ )
[20:27:16] <cisc> that is the stable for Windows?
[20:27:23] <zetok> yep
[20:28:03] <cisc> so then the OBS package for 'nix, that is a little behind then
[20:28:26] <cisc> because you said 1.5.2 == 1.5.1
[20:28:40] <zetok> -.-
[20:28:56] <cisc> or are you just refering to the version number of the OBS package
[20:29:57] <zetok> version number
[20:30:14] <cisc> I see
[20:31:13] <iphy> does 1.5.2 work on osx?
[20:31:39] <zetok> there's no 1.5.2 for osx
[20:31:50] <iphy> ok, so 1.4 is the latest working version for osx?
[20:32:11] <zetok> technically, 1.5.1 for osx works if one installs deps/links to deps
[20:32:34] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3747
[20:32:53] <zetok> (there's a work-around listed there)
[20:33:22] <iphy> ah
[20:33:36] <iphy> good
[20:36:08] <cisc> this one https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3747#issuecomment-253609267
[20:36:55] <iphy> yes
