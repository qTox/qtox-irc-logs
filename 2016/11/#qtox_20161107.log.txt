[13:05:42] <MiokIry> i use non-central-server chat software cuz cops went to my home just for some trifle political jokes i made on central based blogs :D
[13:09:12] <MiokIry> cryptocat though its server is in a denmark nuclear bunker, i can't trust on that
[13:21:26] <iphy> Isn't cryptocat end to end encrypted?
[13:31:45] <MiokIry> yep, but connection list based on central server
[13:33:10] <MiokIry> i meant another one exposed shits to cops, cryptocat is safe but not enough imo
[13:33:44] <MiokIry> tox network is perfect, but development is too slow XD
[13:41:48] <zetok> more people helping would speed up development :)
[13:49:11] <iphy> MiokIry: https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/milestone/7
[13:49:24] <iphy> MiokIry: this week's tasks
[13:49:39] <iphy> MiokIry: you're welcome to help with any of them
[13:52:50] <MiokIry> cool, let me see what i could help on that ;D
[13:54:52] <MiokIry> D:
[13:55:43] <MiokIry> i think i should learn more about c first D:
[13:56:32] <iphy> yes :)
[13:56:33] <zetok> you don't need to learn C to help
[13:56:40] <iphy> for these ones yes
[13:56:49] <iphy> MiokIry: what do you know?
[13:56:53] <zetok> MiokIry: what languages do you know?
[13:56:54] <MiokIry> i write java, sorry about that D:
[13:57:25] <zetok> iphy: tox4j needs java help, right?
[13:57:49] <iphy> yeah
[13:57:52] <iphy> or scala
[13:58:04] <zetok> MiokIry: aside from tox4j, there's Antox – it's written in scala
[13:58:14] <iphy> MiokIry: do you know android?
[13:58:40] <iphy> zetok: as is toktok, and that's a better entry point
[13:58:46] <MiokIry> im sooooo sorry D:
[13:58:59] <iphy> MiokIry: java is fine too
[13:59:28] <zetok> iphy: ok, didn't know that
[13:59:48] <MiokIry> im not sure if i could write scala D:
[14:00:09] <zetok> MiokIry: don't worry about that :)
[14:00:49] <iphy> MiokIry: you can write java
[14:00:58] <iphy> the scala we use is almost like java anyway
[14:01:02] <MiokIry> on what
[14:01:03] <iphy> just a slightly different syntax
[14:01:21] <iphy> MiokIry: do you have an android phone, and are you interested in working on an android tox client?
[14:01:40] <iphy> alternatively, there are some things to be done in tox4j
[14:01:43] <MiokIry> I use ios bro XD
[14:01:46] <iphy> group chats are currently not supported
[14:01:49] <iphy> MiokIry: ok then, no android
[14:01:56] <zetok> https://github.com/TokTok/jvm-toxcore-c ?
[14:01:59] <iphy> group chats need to be added to tox4j
[14:02:00] <iphy> zetok: yes
[14:02:12] <iphy> and also jvm-toxcore, which doesn't have the group chats api at the moment
[14:04:07] <MiokIry> seems i have to be familiar with toxcore first...
[14:04:47] <iphy> maybe
[14:04:59] <iphy> MiokIry: you could build some small program with java using tox4
[14:05:01] <iphy> tox4j*
[14:05:13] <iphy> MiokIry: there is a test GUI client that you could extend
[14:05:13] <MiokIry> like..?
[14:05:45] <iphy> would that be interesting?
[14:05:48] <MiokIry> oh i can try to write GUI
[14:05:56] <iphy> you can also make your own, if you know how to do gui programming in java
[14:05:58] <MiokIry> sounds nice
[14:06:10] <iphy> the one I wrote is really crappy and it's just there for testing
[14:06:35] <iphy> MiokIry: so, first step: install jvm-toxcore-c
[14:07:06] <iphy> MiokIry: zetok pasted a link earlier, get that and run "make all"
[14:07:12] <iphy> if that fails, let me know
[14:07:16] <MiokIry> will it slow down the progress if im too slow in dev?
[14:07:24] <zetok> nah
[14:07:35] <zetok> don't worry about that
[14:08:23] <MiokIry> thx, cuz im now in school, cruel GPA is waiting for me...
[14:11:04] <MiokIry> so does it mean im working on my own if im making my own tox client? :\
[14:12:59] <iphy> MiokIry: I can help a bit
[14:16:08] <MiokIry> i hope i wont disturb on you guys, i meant
[14:17:55] <iphy> I think it would be useful
[14:18:46] <MiokIry> such as checking bugs?
[14:19:49] <MiokIry> i'll try my best
[14:20:39] <MiokIry> wiki and doc is helpful enough i think :P
[14:26:00] <MiokIry> iphy tox4j is jvm-toxcore-c right?
[14:26:28] <iphy> Yes
[14:26:44] <MiokIry> thx
[14:27:40] <MiokIry> does jvm-toxcore-api enough for dev?
[14:31:34] <MiokIry> k, seems to be
[14:32:50] <MiokIry> anyway, time to sleep, gtg :P
[14:34:38] <iphy> MiokIry: yes, it is
[14:34:41] <iphy> goodnight

[16:19:05] <initramfs> So far my debugging has been done through calling a friend in the states and telling them what to do

[16:20:40] <cisc> How come https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:antonbatenev:tox/qtox would have a rebuild time of today (came through as on update) when the package changed value on OBS reads 9 days ago?
[16:24:55] <zetok> Diadlo, initramfs, sudden6: https://github.com/qTox/qtox-irc-logs/blob/8dd57aef00fc4d65181b2ce85c8949912782b195/2016/11/%23qtox_20161103.log.txt#L131,L142 ← since ui/redesign is being slowly merged in chunks by Diadlo, there's no reason to wait with improvements after it's done fully, right?
[16:26:47] <zetok> also, what do you think about moving some repos to gitlab? the ones that can be moved without problems
[16:27:03] <initramfs> Diadlo would give a more authoritative answer, I'm afraid I don't know enough about the redesign to say anything about it.
[16:27:14] <sudden6> ↑ same
[16:28:00] <initramfs> Regarding gitlab, do you intend to run it as a mirror for gitlab or to have all development move to GitLab?
[16:28:12] <initramfs> mirror for GitHub*
[16:28:25] <zetok> https://gitlab.com/qTox ← there is already a mirror :D
[16:28:59] <sudden6> zetok: I would keep it at github for the moment because of the much bigger community (or do you have different data?)
[16:29:11] <zetok> so what I'm proposing is doing it the other way around for repos that don't matter as much
[16:29:29] <zetok> i.e. repo on gitlab, and mirror of it on github with a link to gitlab repo
[16:29:53] <zetok> the repos that I have in mind are irc logs, and website
[16:30:09] <zetok> although right now only irc logs could be "migrated"
[16:30:22] <initramfs> Well
[16:30:38] <initramfs> I assume this is all part of a plan to migrate to GitLab
[16:31:19] <zetok> sudden6: um, I don't have qTox repo in mind yet
[16:32:03] <zetok> for repos that are as big (number of PRs, issues, comments) there are bugs in gitlab's import functionality
[16:32:07] <sudden6> zetok: still, also the website could use some community love
[16:32:29] <zetok> it didn't see much of it so far
[16:34:50] <sudden6> I don't think that'll change with an even less know hosting site
[16:35:10] <sudden6> zetok: I couldn't repro the bogus error messages with your instructions
[16:35:17] <zetok> hmm
[16:35:47] <sudden6> did you use a profile with new encryption or old one?
[16:35:57] <zetok> a new profile
[16:36:23] <sudden6> me too
[16:37:09] <zetok> >qTox couldn't open your chat logs, they will be disabled.
[16:37:10] <zetok> :|
[16:37:15] <zetok> perfectly reproducible
[16:37:29] <sudden6> then I need more details
[16:37:40] <iphy> oh yeah, I got that too
[16:37:46] <iphy> product excellence
[16:38:30] <zetok> sudden6: ok, what details do you need?
[16:38:33] <sudden6> I did: Create new profile, close qTox, open qTox, try login with wrong pw, login with correct pw -> success, no errors
[16:38:48] <sudden6> ↑ See if I did something different than you
[16:39:11] <zetok> I didn't close qTox at the first try
[16:40:56] <sudden6> ah, now I got it too
[16:41:14] <sudden6> but after creating a new profile
[16:47:42] <zetok> so, anyone against moving git logs to the gitlab, and only having a mirror of it on github?
[16:47:49] <zetok> s/git/irc/
[16:50:12] <sudden6> zetok: no
[16:50:23] <sudden6> (I'm not against it)

[17:07:23] <sudden6> interesting
[17:07:24] <zetok> de-select, logout, login, select, logout, login, and qTox claims that it can't open the history, and that it will be disabled, even though checkbox is set

[17:24:14] <zetok> hello
[17:24:17] <sudden6> hi
[17:24:46] <Diadl0> Hi
[17:24:47] <ch0k3> I'm looking for alternatives to PRISM apps, like skype or gchat and I came across tox
[17:25:18] <ch0k3> however last time I tried it was almost impossible to use it 
[17:25:31] <ch0k3> loads of bugs and the application (utox) was not stable
[17:25:40] <ch0k3> I see that its still in the alpha version
[17:25:43] <zetok> when was that?
[17:25:55] <zetok> er
[17:25:56] <ch0k3> around 10 to 12 months ago
[17:26:08] <zetok> so, about µTox
[17:26:28] <zetok> I won't say a bad word, since there's a ceasefire, but IMO you really should try qTox instead
[17:26:44] <ch0k3> is qtox really better?
[17:26:55] <zetok> Yes.
[17:27:03] <ch0k3> utox at the time was a winner, given its lightweight platform
[17:27:08] <zetok> starting from philosophy, and ending on technology
[17:27:13] <ch0k3> oh
[17:27:17] <ch0k3> I did not know that
[17:27:30] <ch0k3> and does it supports all the features as utox client supports?
[17:27:46] <Diadl0> ch0k3: Not all
[17:27:47] <ch0k3> file transfer, video conference calls
[17:27:50] <zetok> yes and no
[17:27:55] <ch0k3> tell me about :)
[17:28:17] <ch0k3> the read.me on github is a little bit vague, I confess
[17:28:19] <zetok> there are no video conference calls
[17:28:30] <ch0k3> ..readme.md (sorry)
[17:28:46] <zetok> about readme, it could make use of improvements
[17:29:04] <zetok> I mean, I could write down all the features that qTox has, but that would be a long list, and hard to parse
[17:29:11] *** Joins: abbat (~Anton@ )
[17:30:04] <ch0k3> but does it supports, apart from the video conf., all the normal features one should expect from an app that is suppose to compete with utox?
[17:30:06] <zetok> as for supported features, qTox has quite a few that µTox doesn't, and µTox has a slightly better support for file transfers right now, perhaps a feature or 2 that qTox doesn't have
[17:30:17] <zetok> qTox doesn't compete
[17:30:20] <zetok> it's simply better
[17:30:23] <ch0k3> my mainly use is video calls and calls
[17:30:36] <ch0k3> zetok: in which regard?
[17:30:47] <zetok> ><zetok> starting from philosophy, and ending on technology
[17:30:53] <zetok> the way I see it, every :)
[17:30:54] <ch0k3> is there a benchmark matrix that could outline the features in details?
[17:31:01] <zetok> but I might be biased a little bit :P
[17:31:10] <ch0k3> zetok: are you a qtox dev.? :P
[17:31:27] <zetok> maybe? :D
[17:31:32] <ch0k3> oh
[17:31:36] <ch0k3> that explains :P
[17:32:01] <zetok> I don't really write the client code, so I'm not sure if I would call myself a qTox dev
[17:32:05] <ch0k3> for me as an user, the utox in its descriptions is quite complete 
[17:32:12] <ch0k3> however I don't find the same in qtox
[17:32:17] <zetok> oh?
[17:32:20] <zetok> what's missing?
[17:32:30] <ch0k3> features list for instance
[17:32:36] <ch0k3> as an example
[17:32:54] <zetok> ok, where that list should be put?
[17:32:56] <ch0k3> if you go to the supported clients of the tox protocol
[17:32:59] <ch0k3> you see this
[17:33:07] <ch0k3> µTox is the lightweight client with minimal dependencies; it not only looks pretty, it runs fast! µTox is available for Windows, OS X, and Linux (Android support is experimental), with full support for chat, file transfers, audio/video calling, and desktop sharing (both as video and inline screenshots). It also supports text group chats with audio groups pending the next Toxcore update.
[17:33:15] <zetok> >ch0k3> if you go to the supported clients of the tox protocol
[17:33:16] <zetok> err
[17:33:24] <ch0k3> while for the qtox
[17:33:44] <ch0k3> you only have this - 'A Qt graphical user interface for Tox.'
[17:33:47] <zetok> there's not much that I can do about that
[17:34:03] <zetok> https://qtox.github.io/ ← the qTox website btw
[17:34:26] <ch0k3> ah
[17:34:29] <zetok> as for that "description", again, I don't want to say a bad word

[17:34:44] <zetok> np
[17:34:47] <ch0k3> zetok: thx
[17:35:22] <ch0k3> similary to utox, it's still on alpha 
[17:35:57] <ch0k3> but is it usable, still?
[17:35:57] <zetok> err, no, I wouldn't say so
[17:36:02] <Diadl0> [20:34] <ch0k3> I miss the feature list on githib <--- zetok: It's time to add it in the header :D

[19:24:04] <abbat> sudden6, Yes it make sense. Most people don't use emoticons and splitting can decrease package size.

[19:24:46] <zetok> abbat: how do you ensure that people get emoticons installed?
[19:24:56] <sudden6> Most people don't use emoticons <- I don't think that's true
[19:25:29] <sudden6> we should atleast ship one complete set by default

[22:38:00] <initramfs> Regarding compiler version, that code assumes gcc/g++ and will fail when using other compilers like clang
[22:40:16] <iphy> initramfs: how's the reformatting?
[22:40:46] <initramfs> Well, the rules PR hasn't been merged yet
[22:40:58] <initramfs> And I'm looking into other tools like clang-tidy
[22:41:27] <initramfs> Because it seems like if we can get something like clang-tidy set up, all the rules that were previously "unenforceable" become trivial
[22:42:21] <iphy> yes
[22:42:39] <iphy> clang-tidy is great
[22:42:43] <initramfs> Oh and for the record, I completely agree with your issue on instance pointers calling static functions should be banned
[22:42:58] <iphy> good
[22:43:00] <initramfs> But I just don't see a way to reliably pick them out
[22:43:12] <initramfs> Again, clang-tidy could help
[22:43:41] <initramfs> Because you have to understand, not all of these things occur as a consequence of one individual accidentally using a instance pointer
[22:43:56] <initramfs> It could be through evolution of code that a member function was made static
[22:44:47] <initramfs> And trying to catch every single use of said function during a review is difficult, especially if it was not clearly stated that the member function was converted into a static member function
[22:45:29] <iphy> ((Core *)nullptr)->staticFun();
[22:46:05] <iphy> initramfs: UB or not?
[22:47:11] <iphy> in fact
[22:47:29] <iphy> initramfs: ((Core *)nullptr)->nonStaticNonVirtualFun(); // UB?
[22:48:58] <initramfs> Probably
[22:50:26] <iphy> initramfs: no
[22:50:30] <iphy> why?
[22:50:36] <iphy> and why probably? why not definitely?
[22:51:30] <iphy> also, yes, it's hard to detect the static function called through pointer thing
[22:51:38] <iphy> you'd need to write a clang-tidy plugin :)
[22:51:50] <iphy> I'm surprised there is no analysis for it already
[22:53:06] <initramfs> Yes I know, I'd be writing a few plugins
[22:53:36] <initramfs> > and why probably? why not definitely? Because there is probably some obscure rule in the standard that forbids or defines some behaviour that I don't know about
[22:54:57] <iphy> ok
[22:55:20] <iphy> anyway, no it's not UB
[22:56:12] *** Joins: jjuran_ (~jjuran@ )

[22:57:15] <iphy> but general consensus is that just dereferencing a null pointer is not UB, just using the lvalue resulting from it is
[22:58:30] <initramfs> Well, as part of the function call, isn't the result of the dereferenced pointer being used?

[22:59:03] <iphy> only if inside the function you use it

[23:06:17] <iphy> it can be dereferenced, and the resulting lvalue can be bound to an lvalue reference
[23:06:22] <initramfs> Yeah
[23:06:34] <initramfs> Talk about type safety...
[23:07:30] <iphy> it's totally type safe :)
[23:08:15] <initramfs> Yes

[23:33:16] <initramfs> Hmm
[23:33:33] <initramfs> Interestingly null dereference is UB in C
[23:38:48] <iphy> yep
[23:40:01] <iphy> initramfs: and clang implements it correctly
[23:42:09] <initramfs> What does that mean, how does one "implement UB correctly"
[23:44:20] <iphy> in that in C++ it's not UB :)
[23:49:47] <initramfs> Oh yeah I tried it
[23:50:14] <initramfs> Clang has a lovely -Weverything flag
[23:50:33] <initramfs> Which I essentially use as a "can't be bothered to check the standard, let's just see what clang says"
[23:52:05] *** Joins: DaSpirit (~DaSpirit@ )
[23:55:32] <iphy> initramfs: yeah, that's useful

[23:56:14] *** Quits: bashrc (~motters@ ) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[23:56:34] <iphy> I think gcc also has -Weverything now
[23:57:39] <initramfs> Really? My GCC 6.2 doesn't seem to understand it
[23:58:13] <initramfs> gcc: error: unrecognized command line option ‘-Weverything’
[23:58:22] <initramfs> gcc (Gentoo Hardened 6.2.0-r1 p1.1) 6.2.0
[23:58:58] <iphy> ok, maybe not
