[11:41:43] <Diadlo> Hi
[11:41:44] <zetok> sudden6: about your point that continuous rebasing is problematic – I was wondering if the problem wouldn't exist to begin with if the review process was going more smoothly..
[11:42:13] <sudden6> zetok: what do you want to improve in it?
[11:42:43] <zetok> um
[11:42:56] <zetok> right
[11:43:22] <zetok> can you say that reviewing goes as smoothly as it can?
[11:44:26] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] zetok closed pull request #3888: feat(UI): add accessibility labels to the Profile page (master...feat-access-profile) https://git.io/vX9e1
[11:44:29] <sudden6> there's always room for improvements, but what concrete thing do you want to improve?
[11:45:30] <zetok> time
[11:46:42] <sudden6> and how?
[11:46:44] <zetok> i.e. it would be nice if there was some guarantee for contributors that their PR will be at least looked at within $x time since they've created it
[11:47:14] <zetok> Diadlo: btw, have you seen the mail on qTox-dev ML?
[11:47:41] <sudden6> zetok: I'm not sure we can guarantee this somehow
[11:47:42] <Diadlo> zetoc: Yes. Sorry, I haven't time to reply
[11:47:51] <sudden6> ↑ because of this
[11:48:01] <zetok> Diadlo: no problem, just making sure that you didn't miss it
[11:48:08] <sudden6> we're all doing this in our free time
[11:48:12] <Diadlo> Yes. I will do it now
[11:49:18] <zetok> sudden6: um, is a week still not enough time to even look at the PR and say that you need more time for review?
[11:49:52] <sudden6> well, I think we have that time now < 1 week
[11:50:06] <zetok> nope
[11:50:15] <zetok> there were PRs that exceeded that
[11:50:59] <zetok> good thing that those were made by me, so no harm done
[11:51:36] <zetok> but if it was made by someone who was hoping to become a new qTox contributor, they could get disappointed
[11:51:37] <sudden6> zetok: could it be that those were some bash script changes?
[11:51:44] <zetok> :|
[11:51:47] <zetok> maybe?
[11:52:01] <sudden6> because I looked at some of them, but had no idea what to comment/say
[11:52:19] <Diadlo> +1
[11:52:20] <sudden6> so I thought someone more skilled would pick them up
[11:52:31] <sudden6> well, there's our problem xD
[11:52:46] <zetok> so, here's the thing
[11:52:55] <zetok> if it's not clear what something does, comment on that
[11:53:27] <sudden6> most of the time it's clear what it does, but I can't say if it's done in a good way
[11:53:43] <zetok> it's bash
[11:53:54] <sudden6> but I can change that behavior of mine
[11:54:00] <zetok> you bash it into shape until it works

[11:57:20] <sudden6> Diadlo: +1
[11:57:22] <zetok> thanks
[11:57:41] <zetok> Diadlo: usually there are docs
[11:57:52] <zetok> (for both clog and travis)
[11:58:20] <Diadlo> `usually` <- Yep
[11:59:28] <zetok> I mean, there are docs
[11:59:39] <zetok> since I make my changes based on the info that docs provide
[11:59:55] <zetok> https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/YAMLSyntax.html ← docs
[11:59:58] <zetok> ;D
[12:00:05] <sudden6> zetok: most of the time the "how" isn't the problem, but the "why"
[12:00:22] <zetok> right, and that should be in commit msg/comments
[12:00:28] <sudden6> why is a change necessary and what does it improve?
[12:00:33] <zetok> if that's lacking, commit msg/comments should be changed/added
[12:00:42] <sudden6> these two questions should be answered in the commit message
[12:02:10] <zetok> ok, an example?

[12:03:06] <sudden6> probably not the best example
[12:03:22] <zetok> um, I meant an example where stuff is missing
[12:03:30] <sudden6> oh
[12:03:33] <zetok> so that I would know what to avoid

[12:07:47] <sudden6> for example, could use an explanation why they help with automation
[12:08:11] <zetok> hmm
[12:08:19] <zetok> docs explain that
[12:09:05] <sudden6> then a link to the docs is nice
[12:09:32] <sudden6> ie. changed as recommended in [link to doc]
[12:09:54] <zetok> there is one in CONTRIBUTING.md
[12:10:09] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-git-commit-guidelines
[12:10:10] <sudden6> no, I mean directly in the commit or PR message
[12:10:20] <zetok> >changed as recommended
[12:10:26] <zetok> it's a config option
[12:11:03] <sudden6> that was just an example
[12:11:07] <zetok> right
[12:14:51] <zetok> so the problem is finding docs, or their relevant parts?
[12:19:30] <sudden6> yep
[12:19:42] <sudden6> especially the "relevant parts" stuff
[12:20:13] <zetok> ok
[12:24:28] <zetok> what do you think about providing a HTML version of docs like user manual and CONTRIBUTING.md ?
[12:24:42] <zetok> and install.md
[12:25:27] <sudden6> zetok: having a version of our user manual on the website would be awesome
[12:25:48] <zetok> oh, is that so

[13:40:46] <zetok> sudden6: is there really no better way to signal that deriving key failed?
[13:42:14] <zetok> sudden6: do you zero the password/key memory?
[13:42:53] <sudden6> zetok: no, no password/key memory zeroing, wasn't done before and is out of scope of this PR imo
[13:43:06] <zetok> IMO it's not
[13:43:08] <sudden6> (could do it in a follow up tough)
[13:43:42] <zetok> is there something like `Drop` in C++?
[13:44:01] <zetok> (a way to specify how something should be free'd)
[13:44:15] <sudden6> free != zeroed
[13:44:19] <sudden6> in C++
[13:44:20] <zetok> pls.
[13:44:32] <zetok> we're not talking about just freeing memory
[13:45:00] <zetok> I'm talking about a way to specify how given type should be treated when it comes to its destruction
[13:45:10] <zetok> "freeing"
[13:45:13] <sudden6> C++ uses destructors for that

[17:40:10] <zetok> src/main.rs:114:30: 114:54 note:    found type `std::ops::RangeTo<u8>`
[17:40:25] <sudden6> yep, I don't understand the meaning
[17:40:27] <zetok> seems quite clear?
[17:40:40] <sudden6> I want to create a 2d array of bool
[17:40:44] <zetok> ok, whatever you're feeding wants `bool` value
[17:40:57] <zetok> what you're providing is a Range
[17:41:21] <zetok> 1..4 range
[17:41:24] <zetok> ..4 range
[17:41:30] <zetok> 4.. infinite range
[17:41:46] <zetok> "infinite"
[17:42:09] <zetok> sudden6: in other words, you're not using a valid Rust syntax for what you're doing
[17:42:14] <sudden6> isn't the syntax for an array [initVal, ..nrOfElements] ?
[17:42:28] <zetok> nope
[17:42:39] <sudden6> and how is the correct syntax? I didn't find anything helpful in the docs
[17:42:47] <zetok> [val; number of items]
[17:43:06] <zetok> [val, val, val] ← an array with 3 items
[17:43:27] <sudden6> aw, crap
[17:44:05] <zetok> btw, you might want to work on Vec instead
[17:45:15] <zetok> sudden6: um, if you're not sure about the syntax, just ask
[17:45:27] <zetok> and when it comes to syntax, rust reference is really great
[17:45:31] <sudden6> I got the syntax now
[17:45:52] <sudden6> > rust reference is really great <- I can't really agree with that...
[17:46:25] <zetok> hm?

[17:56:48] <sudden6> not today, sorry
[17:57:19] <sudden6> when will rust start to break things less often?
[17:57:34] <zetok> Rust doesn't break things
[17:57:37] <sudden6> ie changes in years not in months
[17:58:10] <zetok> there's just new stuff introduced in the newer versions, and some people have a need to depend on the features
[17:58:28] <sudden6> >Rust doesn't break things <- pretty wrong imho
[17:58:37] <zetok> hm?
[17:58:45] <sudden6> well, it broke for me
[17:58:57] <zetok> what broke?
[17:59:03] <sudden6> the image crate
[17:59:09] <zetok> except that it's not
[17:59:29] <zetok> there's a dependency on Rust >=1.12
[17:59:31] <sudden6> my rust is only 2 versions older than the latest release, that's 12 weeks and it broke
[17:59:51] <zetok> ..
[18:00:21] <sudden6> ok, to reword my question, when will a rust version appear that won't change for 5 years
[18:00:25] <zetok> you're using an old version, and you're complaining that it doesn't work with the code that depends on features introduced in newer version
[18:00:37] <zetok> there's no reason for that to happen
[18:00:49] <sudden6> that's bad
[18:00:53] <zetok> not really
[18:00:57] <sudden6> yes really
[18:01:32] <sudden6> if you want a greater adoption of rust there has to be some stability
[18:01:37] <zetok> there is
[18:01:47] <zetok> and people are using it
[18:01:52] <sudden6> introducing new stuff every 6 weeks isn't what I call stable
[18:02:04] <zetok> if your distro doesn't want you to get newest software, that's your problem
[18:02:15] <zetok> not breaking things is stable
[18:02:24] <zetok> you might want to also fix your definition of stability
[18:02:47] <zetok> the code that compiled on 1.10 compiles just fine on 1.13
[18:02:53] <zetok> that is stable, and will be
[18:03:13] <zetok> that's the same thing with gcc/clang
[18:03:38] <zetok> try to compile code that depends on features introduced in newer compiler with an older compiler and complain that it doesn't work
[18:03:49] <sudden6> yeah, but if stuff is always developed for the newest version there will never be a big codebase you can reuse
[18:04:11] <zetok> I develop for the version that I can
[18:04:22] <sudden6> zetok: in C there are standards like C89/C99
[18:04:39] <zetok> initially that was 1.9, but 1.11 brought some new features that I needed and some nice fixes that made things easier, so now I depend on 1.11
[18:05:03] <zetok> yeah, we all know that C predates dinosaurs
[18:05:50] <zetok> sudden6: and there are newer C standards too AFAIK
[18:05:59] <sudden6> the key point is, that you can compile most of the stuff on hardware where the compiler is 10 years old
[18:06:14] <zetok> sudden6: have you tried to compile that code with a compiler that supports only C89?
[18:07:24] <sudden6> zetok: this won't work and I'm not arguing about that, but currently everyone uses C99, and you can go atleast 5 years back in time and compile your stuff
[18:07:37] <zetok> if your distro doesn't provide you with newest Rust, rustup does the job quite well with `rustup update`
[18:07:51] <sudden6> mhm
[18:08:45] <zetok> >this won't work and I'm not arguing about that
[18:08:50] <zetok> it sounded like you did
[18:10:21] <sudden6> then I've misworded something
