[21:52:49] <sudden6> initramfs: merge #3860 ?
[21:53:22] <initramfs> Yeah I'll do it now
[21:54:29] <initramfs> Done
[21:54:29] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] initramfs pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vXw8H
[21:54:29] -qtox-git-spam- qTox/master 28c2915 initramfs: fix(ui): prevent text style from being reset during retranslation...
[21:54:47] <sudden6> nice thx :)
[21:59:03] <sudden6> initramfs: Diadlo suggested adding "src" to the include path, removing it from include paths, what do you think about this?
[21:59:38] <initramfs> Hmm
[22:00:08] <initramfs> Well, I don't mind either I guess
[22:00:28] <sudden6> IMO it makes sense, it removes redundancy
[22:00:37] <initramfs> Sure
[22:01:06] <Diadlo> Hi everyone :)

[22:34:18] <iphy> Including Qt
[22:35:39] <initramfs> Right
[22:49:41] <vindelschtuffen> is qtox from master compiling right now?
[22:50:56] <sudden6> vindelschtuffen: yes
[22:51:04] <vindelschtuffen> sudden6: thanks
[22:51:22] <sudden6> qtox master should nearly always build
[22:51:34] <sudden6> at least thats what we try ;)
[22:54:35] <vindelschtuffen> currently I'm failing to compile it, just wanted to make sure it was me :)
[22:58:19] <sudden6> Would it be desireable to compile qTox with -Wall -Wextra ?
[22:58:31] <sudden6> and not generate >1k warnings?
[22:58:44] <sudden6> also -Wold-style-cast is nice

[23:05:09] <sudden6> I'm currently reading gcc docs about possible -Wsomething options, as enabling everything isn't currently viable I think

[23:10:08] *** Quits: rerumnovarum (~user-reru@ ) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[23:18:34] <iphy> sudden6: enable everything, then selectively disable things until you have no more warnings
[23:19:14] <iphy> sudden6: then you can go and disable each suppression flag individually and inspect the warnings to decide whether to keep suppressing, or whether that warning makes sense and needs to be fixed
[23:20:10] <sudden6> iphy: thx, good idea
[23:29:27] *** Quits: smaragdus (~omoo@ ) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:47:43] <sudden6> seems like current state isn't a lost case, -Wall -Wextra -pedantic cause only a few warnings about variable length arrays being unsupported in ISO C++
[23:50:14] <iphy> they are also unsupported in msvc
[23:50:27] <iphy> I guess you're not targetting that
[23:50:36] <sudden6> nope
[23:50:52] <sudden6> is qt even supporting msvc?
[23:50:57] <sudden6> I don't think so
[23:51:03] <iphy> stack overflows are much more fun than std::vector
[23:51:19] <iphy> sudden6: I think so
[23:51:51] <iphy> https://wiki.qt.io/Building_Qt_Desktop_for_Windows_with_MSVC
[23:53:09] <sudden6> doesn't look like a well supported page
[23:55:44] <sudden6> https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-building.html seems it's possible
