[06:16:35] <koshii> Is creating group chats totally broken in the current stable (opensuse repo) qtox?

[10:24:07] <koshii> Are groups compatible between uTox and qTox?

[12:20:45] <zetok> koshii: have you tried with qgroupbot ?
[12:25:31] <koshii> zetok: No I have not, what and how?
[12:25:40] <zetok> koshii: it's in the topic :)
[12:25:45] <koshii> Ah!
[12:26:11] <koshii> That works. The issue seems to be creating new group chats.
[12:26:20] <koshii> Anyway I'll narrow it down and make an issue on GitHub...
[12:27:51] <zetok> um
[12:28:04] <zetok> are other people you've tried to invite using qTox?
[12:28:16] <koshii> uTox
[12:28:23] <zetok> hmm
[12:28:31] <zetok> it kinda sounds like µTox is broken
[12:28:35] <koshii> Probably...
[12:28:50] <koshii> Windows users love it though -- single small exe ftw?
[12:29:23] <zetok> qTox also could have something like that
[12:29:48] <koshii> Could or does?
[12:29:53] <zetok> could
[12:30:02] <zetok> i.e. it's ~doable
[12:30:06] <koshii> :)
[12:30:07] <koshii> Great
[12:30:21] <zetok> could ≠ will
[12:30:27] <koshii> I understand that
[12:36:18] <zetok> perhaps you could ask people to try with qTox
[12:36:29] <koshii> Will do
[12:36:35] <zetok> thanks :)
[12:39:42] <koshii> Thank you!

[20:01:17] <zetok> ?
[20:01:37] <zetok> how does it help?
[20:01:44] <Diadlo> You will see

[20:03:59] <zetok> yes, I still don't get how does that help
[20:04:15] <Diadlo> Hm...
[20:04:21] <zetok> lupdate should handle deduplicating
[20:04:32] <zetok> if it doesn't, then that's a bug, and should be fixed in it
[20:04:37] <Diadlo> No
[20:04:50] <zetok> um?
[20:05:02] <Diadlo> This is translations from different scopes

[20:05:45] <zetok> ok, I see
