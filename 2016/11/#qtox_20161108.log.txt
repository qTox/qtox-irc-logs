[22:17:00] <zetok> Diadlo: pong
[22:17:33] <Diadlo> To tests we need to split qtox on 3 parts: client + static library + tests
[22:17:58] <Diadlo> What you think: which structure should be?
[22:18:18] <zetok> um?
[22:18:34] <zetok> sorry, I'm not sure what the question is about
[22:18:45] <Diadlo> Ok. Wait a minute
[22:20:24] <Diadlo> https://gist.github.com/Diadlo/68450b5a158ccc25720de054715f6c14
[22:22:12] <zetok> hmm
[22:22:20] <zetok> s/client/ui/ ?
[22:22:22] <Diadlo> 1) Do we need `src/` folder, if we didn't split headers in different ones? 2) Where should be `translation/`?
[22:22:41] <zetok> 1. – yes, those dirs would go under it
[22:23:06] <zetok> translations can stay where they are..?
[22:23:35] <zetok> or would translations need to be split too?
[22:23:37] <Diadlo> In real, client will not contain ui. Only main
[22:23:49] <zetok> oh, I see
[22:24:36] *** Joins: DaSpirit (~DaSpirit@ )
[22:24:40] <Diadlo> We can leave `translations` here, but libqtox will contains related path to it
[22:24:56] <Diadlo> I think it's not a problem
[22:25:53] <Diadlo> [01:22] <zetok> 1. – yes, those dirs would go under it <-- Sorry, I don't understand
[22:26:08] <zetok> src/{client,libqtox,tests}
[22:26:21] <Diadlo> Hm...
[22:26:57] <Diadlo> So *.pro files will be in the same directory with sources
[22:27:02] <Diadlo> Are you sure?
[22:28:04] <zetok> I'm not
[22:28:11] <zetok> just wondering if that wouldn't be better
[22:28:25] *** Joins: athan (~athan@ )
[22:28:32] <Diadlo> Who can know right way?
[22:28:33] <zetok> e.g. src/libqtox/src/toxid.cpp
[22:28:40] <Diadlo> M...
[22:28:54] <Diadlo> Better remove first `src/`
[22:29:51] <zetok> ok
[22:30:04] <Diadlo> iphy: ping?
[22:30:08] <zetok> what about having .pro files just under `src/` ?
[22:30:27] <iphy> Diadlo: pong
[22:30:32] <zetok> src/libqtox.pro ; src/libqtox/toxid.cpp
[22:30:56] <Diadlo> It's Qt limitation. We should have `{dir}/{dir}.pro`
[22:31:02] <zetok> oh
[22:31:10] <Diadlo> iphy: What you think about project structure?
[22:31:13] <Diadlo> ^
[22:31:16] <iphy> Diadlo: I have a test in my fork
[22:31:53] <iphy> https://github.com/TokTok/qTox/blob/master/test/core/core_test.cpp
[22:32:02] <Diadlo> zetok: We can migrate on CMake :)
[22:32:35] <zetok> Diadlo: yeah
[22:32:47] <zetok> we probably should do that
[22:33:06] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/1153
[22:36:15] <Diadlo> iphy: does your CMake work correct?
[22:36:31] <iphy> Diadlo: for what value of correct?
[22:36:40] <iphy> it works for me on linux and osx
[22:36:47] <iphy> it works on travis to cross compile to windows
[22:36:54] <iphy> that's all I know
[22:36:59] <Diadlo> Perfect
[22:37:01] <iphy> I haven't tested on windows, and it'll probably not work there
[22:37:04] <iphy> because of pkg-config
[22:37:21] <Diadlo> Why you didn't send the PR?
[22:42:00] <Diadlo> iphy: Ok. Can you send this PR without tests?
