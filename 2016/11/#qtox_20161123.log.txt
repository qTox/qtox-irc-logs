[08:15:50] <nurupo> all i know is that qtox jenkins job depends on it and it was rebuilt when filteraudio was rebuilt https://build.tox.chat/job/qTox_build_windows_x86-64_release/

[20:03:57] <Diadlo> zetok: Hello
[20:04:01] <zetok> Diadlo: hi
[20:04:23] <Diadlo> I was thinking about toktok-migration
[20:04:42] <Diadlo> You say, that we need ~stable v1.0
[20:04:44] <Diadlo> Right?
[20:05:13] <zetok> yep
[20:05:29] <Diadlo> But why current v0.0.0 better?
[20:05:51] <zetok> ?
[20:06:01] <Diadlo> Now we use toxcore v0.0.0
[20:06:15] <zetok> Diadlo: when was the las time that irungentoo/toxcore's API changed?
[20:06:19] <zetok> last*
[20:06:59] <Diadlo> Long time ago. I don't remember
[20:07:15] <Diadlo> Sep 28
[20:07:25] <zetok> err
[20:07:31] <zetok> really?
[20:07:34] <Diadlo> Yep
[20:07:59] <Diadlo> https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/commits/master
[20:08:58] <Diadlo> Oh
[20:09:00] <Diadlo> API
[20:09:01] <Diadlo> Sorry
[20:09:03] <Diadlo> IDK
[20:09:46] <zetok> hint: until someone decided to add newer ebuild, I was casually using toxcore from 2016-02-01
[20:10:35] <zetok> and that old ebuild was already pointing to the API that haven't changed in a long time
[20:11:23] <Diadlo> And what's bad in API changing? 
[20:11:49] <zetok> that stuff breaks, and requires additional maintenance
[20:13:19] <zetok> qTox has to at least build
[20:13:29] <zetok> with an API that is not stable, this is not possible
[20:14:27] <Diadlo> We can use certain version of c-toxcore 
[20:14:34] <zetok> yes, 0.1
[20:14:39] <Diadlo> For example
[20:17:50] <zetok> for example, file transfers, audio, video, faux offline messaging and groupchats were/are in qTox broken due to constantly changing API
[20:18:49] <zetok> just because API in toxcore changed, and qTox needed to get support for it, otherwise it wouldn't build, which led to situation where instead of proper implementation & support dirty hacks where put in place to keep qTox rolling

[20:20:22] <zetok> Emcy: you might want to invest in SASL
[20:22:04] <zetok> Diadlo: after TokTok/toxcore's 0.2 gets released, we have 6 weeks to get to support that
[20:22:29] *** Quits: Emcy (~MC@ ) (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[20:23:14] <zetok> not a lot of time, but hopefully there'll be ~working support for API changes already in a PR
[20:25:04] <zetok> Diadlo: btw, about testing PRs – I start doing that when PR builds and apparent problems with it are fixed
[20:25:20] <zetok> so for TokTok/toxcore PR, I'll start testing it when it'll start building
[20:26:30] <Diadlo> Ок
[20:26:32] <Diadlo> *Ok
[20:27:33] <zetok> Diadlo: btw, `merge --ff-only fix-updater-seralization` ?
[20:28:08] <Diadlo> Hm... Sorry, I don't understand, what you want :)
[20:28:19] <zetok> `git fetch upstream`
[20:28:21] <zetok> :D
[20:28:58] <zetok> aka https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3911
[20:29:14] <zetok> tux3: any luck getting filenames corrupted just the right way?
[20:29:50] <Diadlo> zetok: Ok. I will merge
[20:29:55] <zetok> Diadlo: thanks :)
[20:30:01] <tux3> zetok, nope, the only solution I have would involve downloading a file 0x0101010101010101 bytes long...
[20:30:09] <zetok> :/
[20:30:37] <tux3> It's pretty complicated, so I can't definitely say that it's impossible to find the right magic, but I think I'm going to give up :/
[20:30:48] <zetok> I see
[20:30:52] <zetok> blog post it is then
[20:30:57] <tux3> Sadly, yes
[20:31:24] <tux3> Maybe we should have a fix ready before the blog post though, so people can act on it
[20:31:32] <zetok> yep
[20:32:17] <tux3> I don't know if we should just fix it and hope it doesn't break again, or scrap the whole thing
[20:32:52] <zetok> since it doesn't work anyway, scraping and doing it the right way sounds good
[20:32:53] <tux3> Rewritting it might just introduce some new bugs..
[20:33:25] <zetok> yes, that's why now tests also should be added to new implementation :D
[20:33:37] <tux3> Fair enough, either way tests would be good :)
[20:34:25] <Diadlo> tux3: Hello
[20:34:32] <tux3> Diadlo, hey
[20:34:36] <Diadlo> zetok: We need -O0 ?
[20:34:52] <zetok> Diadlo: `-O2` is fine
[20:34:54] <Diadlo> Ok
[20:35:14] <zetok> -O3 is just a bit too much with C/C++ when you need things to work
[20:35:53] <zetok> (Rust uses by default -O3 when compiling in release mode :D)
[20:37:12] <Diadlo> zetok: I can't ff-only fix-updater-seralization
[20:37:21] <zetok> oh
[20:37:30] <Diadlo> tux3 can rebase and merge
[20:37:38] <Diadlo> Or I can merge with no-ff
[20:37:58] <tux3> I'll rebase and force-push if you want
[20:38:17] <Diadlo> tux3: Sounds good
[20:38:36] <Diadlo> But why you can merge it?
[20:38:50] <tux3> Pushed. I can merge it too if you want.
[20:39:20] <tux3> It's been a while since I merged anything though so there's 50% chance I'll break something ::)
[20:39:31] <zetok> tux3: uh

[20:42:32] <tux3> It gets more complicated everytime :/
[20:42:35] <tux3> So, what about I just cherry-pick the commit and push that to master?
[20:42:50] <zetok> won't work :3
[20:43:00] <zetok> tux3: you don't need the script to rebase, it just makes things easier
[20:43:16] *** Quits: Emcy_ (~MC@ ) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[20:43:20] <zetok> i.e. instead of typing lots of commands, you type 1
[20:43:37] <tux3> zetok, what's the magic required to push things manually?
[20:43:42] <zetok> :f
[20:43:55] <zetok> git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/master && git push -f
[20:44:08] <tux3> Nah I mean without the force :)
[20:44:20] <tux3> Like, what's the requirements?
[20:44:45] <zetok> assuming that it can be fast-forwarded, just `git push`
[20:45:23] <zetok> I mean, the `git push -f` is for pushing to the PR branch, so that travis can build it and check that it still compiles on top of master
[20:45:43] <zetok> from there, `git checkout master && git merge --ff-only branch && git push`
[20:46:49] <tux3> Awesome
[20:47:06] <tux3> So I just need to wait on travis and I can do a normal git merge/git push
[20:47:28] <zetok> why would you do that when you can use scripts
[20:47:40] <zetok> :P
[20:47:45] <tux3> Because I'm annoying and I like to understand how things work :P

[20:55:37] <zetok> (why zetox is no longer being built on osx travis)
[20:57:48] <tux3> I'm just gonna `watch -n 30 git push` and go make me some food :)
