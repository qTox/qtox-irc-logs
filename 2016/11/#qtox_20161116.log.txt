[17:26:54] <zetok> you're doing something wrong
[17:27:01] <zetok> not sure what exactly, but ok

[17:30:46] <zetok> SkyzohKey: ok, fixed it
[17:31:12] <SkyzohKey> thx
[17:31:16] <SkyzohKey> what was the problem ?
[17:31:28] <zetok> nothing?
[17:31:36] <SkyzohKey> ok so problem was me
[17:31:36] <SkyzohKey> x')
[17:31:38] <zetok> there was just a small conflict
[17:31:45] <zetok> (which git tells you about)

[17:34:45] <zetok> SkyzohKey: wouldn't it be better to put that file under res/ ?
[17:34:58] <SkyzohKey> it doesn't go inside the binary
[17:35:05] <SkyzohKey> and .desktop was a project root so...
[17:35:20] <zetok> yeah, I'm wondering if .desktop should be moved too
[17:35:46] *** Joins: jjuran (~jjuran@ )

[17:37:08] <SkyzohKey> :/

[19:25:56] <sudden6> hi
[19:26:16] <zetok> hai
[19:26:29] <Diadlo> Hi
[19:26:37] <zetok> Diadlo: mm, I wonder if that's a problem with the build, or agilob's system
[19:26:47] <zetok> the logs were weird, so to say
[19:27:40] <sudden6> Diadlo: could you lgtm https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3864 again, reviewable dropped it
[19:29:30] <zetok> https://gist.github.com/zetok/5dec3e0b79e6263d4db02391b7c63d5e
[19:32:39] <Diadlo> sudden6: Done :)
[19:33:45] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] sudden6 closed pull request #3864: fix(core): don't emit idSet signal twice (master...fix_idset_emit) https://git.io/vXRAm
[19:34:03] <sudden6> Diadlo: thx :)
[19:34:52] <Diadlo> np
[19:35:00] <sudden6> zetok: ↑ this is the only problem I have with rebase instead of merge, it doesn't scale
[19:35:08] <Diadlo> zetok: What is is?
[19:35:12] <Diadlo> *it
[19:35:19] <sudden6> atleast not with current reviewable
[19:35:51] <zetok> Diadlo: agilob's build problem
[19:35:59] <Diadlo> O_o
[19:36:08] <zetok> sudden6: `lgtm_strong` ?
[19:36:44] <sudden6> zetok: not really an option, because then stuff could change after I gave lgtm and I don't like that
[19:37:07] <zetok> then just use merge-pr.sh script
[19:37:19] <zetok> that'll make me a bit sad inside, but it'll work for you
[19:38:20] <sudden6> the build problem looks like a serious qmake error
[19:38:27] <zetok> SkyzohKey: if you don't mind, I'll just move the file in PR
[19:38:40] <sudden6> or there's a reason `silent` is undocumented
[19:39:50] * zetok afk &
[19:43:14] <Diadlo> sudden6: We plan to migrate to CMake
[19:43:42] <Diadlo> If nobody don't mind
[19:44:09] <sudden6> Diadlo: why?
[19:44:31] <Diadlo> More flexible configuration
[19:44:54] <sudden6> for example?
[19:44:57] <Diadlo> In particular: subprojects
[19:45:31] <sudden6> ok, I think qmake supports that too, but I'm not strongly against cmake
[19:45:46] <Diadlo> qmake requed <subproject-name>/<subproject-name>.pro
[19:46:23] <Diadlo> It requere project structure change
[19:47:19] <sudden6> I suppose you want to use that for tests?
[19:47:55] <Diadlo> Including
[19:49:26] <Diadlo> What you think about name `widget`, `core` as "package"?
[19:49:36] <Diadlo> Or "module"?
[19:54:22] <sudden6> Diadlo: I don't quite understand
[19:54:58] <Diadlo> We have directories `widget`, `core`
[19:55:30] <Diadlo> What they have in common a name?
[19:56:00] <sudden6> hmm, I don't now, module sounds better IMHO
[19:56:19] <sudden6> because a package is something that can work on it's own
[19:57:04] <Diadlo> Thanks
[19:57:49] * sudden6 making the most important decisions lol
[19:59:28] <Diadlo> :D
[20:05:16] * zetok could make use of some deciding
[20:06:38] <zetok> sudden6: https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3779 ?
[20:07:06] <zetok> sudden6: I think that we should do something more than we already do, but not going as far as disabling UDP for everyone
[20:07:35] <zetok> I wonder if there is some way of detecting whether the SOCKS proxy is a tor one
[20:08:54] <sudden6> zetok: how many SOCKS5 proxies support UDP?
[20:09:11] <zetok> theoretically, all of them can
[20:09:13] <sudden6> I don't think there are that many (guess)
[20:10:15] <sudden6> anyway, if we can make sure toxcore isn't sending UDP packets anywhere else than to the proxy we should leave it enabled by default
[20:10:40] <sudden6> since it spreads the load over the network
[20:11:04] <sudden6> else we should turn it of for security
[20:11:21] <sudden6> and tell toktok people to fix it ;)
[20:11:43] <zetok> mm
[20:12:11] <zetok> I'm not sure if I remember correctly, but if I do, toxcore does try to send UDP outside of proxy
[20:12:53] <sudden6> that would be very bad then, since it defeats the proxy...
[20:12:54] <zetok> now, if only Linux had a decent networking stack, we could easily check that
[20:13:05] <zetok> sudden6: nope
[20:13:14] <zetok> sudden6: proxy's purpose is to provide connection
[20:13:24] <iphy> Proxy is TCP only
[20:13:40] <iphy> You need to disable UDP if you want to avoid it
[20:13:49] <iphy> Tor does not support UDP
[20:13:52] <zetok> sudden6: if toxcore achieves a connection outside of proxy, it doesn't defeat purpose of proxy
[20:14:03] <iphy> Proxy was done mainly for tor
[20:14:28] <zetok> proxy was done mainly for proxy, and Tor is a bonus that works due to proxy support
[20:14:39] <sudden6> iphy: do we have to explicitly disable UDP or will toxcore automatically disable it if a proxy is set?
[20:14:56] <iphy> sudden6: don't know, I just asked
[20:15:26] <sudden6> I see
[20:18:08] <sudden6> zetok: so it's pretty clear, we should disable UDP if a proxy is selected
[20:18:33] <zetok> mm
[20:37:34] <Diadlo> sudden6: Can you lgtm #3871?
[20:38:35] <sudden6> Diadlo: done
[20:39:08] <Diadlo> Quid pro quo :)

[21:47:24] <dreadpirate> however I did face a bug
[21:47:29] <dreadpirate> it was the only bug so far
[21:47:37] <zetok> hm?
[21:48:00] <dreadpirate> when someone sends a message when the other party is offline or went immediately offline 
[21:48:06] <dreadpirate> the message is displayed twice
[21:48:27] <zetok> on the receiving side?
[21:48:32] <dreadpirate> yes
[21:48:40] <dreadpirate> for instance
[21:48:49] <dreadpirate> I got a message while I was off
[21:49:00] <dreadpirate> actually I didn't sorry
[21:49:03] <dreadpirate> since I was off
[21:49:07] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/2726
[21:49:25] <dreadpirate> but when I was online again the message was displayed (which is the expected behaviour) 
[21:49:32] <dreadpirate> and another time when the other party joined
[21:49:39] <dreadpirate> so it basically showed up twice
[21:49:48] <dreadpirate> damn

[21:51:33] <dreadpirate> I recall another thing
[21:51:39] <dreadpirate> probably it's on my end
[21:51:41] <zetok> refactoring is going on, but it's slow, given that no one is paid to work on qTox
[21:51:46] <dreadpirate> but I cannot share my screen
[21:52:00] <dreadpirate> zetok: yeah, I understand
[21:52:07] <dreadpirate> zetok: but the project is awesome
[21:52:16] <dreadpirate> I really appreciate all the effort guys
[21:52:24] <dreadpirate> its fantastica
[21:52:35] <dreadpirate> I have been using ricochet so far
[21:52:51] <dreadpirate> and I confess didn't like that much 
[21:53:12] <zetok> :)
[21:53:19] <dreadpirate> given the lack of estability of some of the tor nodes
[21:53:33] <dreadpirate> so moving to tox is being awesome
[21:53:49] <dreadpirate> zetok: if I can contribute in any way
[21:53:52] <dreadpirate> pls let me know
[21:53:54] <zetok> Yes.
[21:54:03] <zetok> we lack a pirate translation of qTox
[21:54:12] <dreadpirate> lol
[21:54:17] <dreadpirate> that is just the name :P
[21:54:30] <zetok> https://qtox.github.io/pr.html ← website has it, but not the client :(
[21:54:37] <zetok> aw
[21:54:45] <zetok> dreadpirate: any other languages?
[21:55:33] <zetok> dreadpirate: if you're feeling adventurous, you could try testing PRs
[21:56:06] <dreadpirate> zetok: PRs?
[21:56:11] <zetok> pull requests
[21:56:13] <dreadpirate> ahh
[21:56:17] <dreadpirate> sorry
[21:56:19] <dreadpirate> sure
[21:56:48] <dreadpirate> I know java, c, c++ (which I have not touch for a longe time now), python, perl 
[21:56:54] <dreadpirate> oh 
[21:56:58] <zetok> ooh, that sounds great
[21:57:08] <dreadpirate> and some other decomissioned languages like prolog :P
[21:57:18] <zetok> there's lots of stuff with the code that could use some help
[21:57:33] <dreadpirate> I do identify myself a lot with this project
[21:57:52] <dreadpirate> I have been looking for an alternative like this for quite a while now
[21:58:03] <dreadpirate> so anything I can do, I'll try my best to
[21:58:04] <zetok> you might want to skim through CONTRIBUTING.md, and look at the issues with the `help wanted` label
[21:59:24] <zetok> dreadpirate: also reviewing PRs would be great
[21:59:34] <dreadpirate> ok
[21:59:39] <dreadpirate> let me take a look at it
[21:59:55] <zetok> (CONTRIBUTING.md describes the workflow)
[22:00:18] <dreadpirate> all commits must be signed?
[22:00:30] *** Joins: Achylles (~Achylles@ )
[22:00:31] <zetok> only maintainers' commits
[22:00:34] <dreadpirate> ah
[22:00:35] <dreadpirate> ok ok 
[22:01:25] <zetok> btw, CONTRIBUTING.md could make some use of improvements, so if you find that it lacks in some aspects, don't hesitate to point that out
[22:03:38] <dreadpirate> ok
[22:03:52] <dreadpirate> I will definately take a look at it
[22:04:08] <dreadpirate> however this seem very stable
[22:04:20] <dreadpirate> my overall experience has been very pleasant I must say
[22:04:42] <dreadpirate> I've tried the other clients and the experience has not been so great
[22:07:31] <dreadpirate> zetok: C++11 
[22:07:48] <zetok> right
[22:07:58] <zetok> there's a PR that adds coding guidelines
[22:07:59] <dreadpirate> not familiarized with that
[22:08:14] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3839
[22:10:39] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3890 there we go :D
[22:12:35] <dreadpirate> oh dear
[22:12:36] <dreadpirate> lol
[22:13:10] <dreadpirate> when you mentioned pirate translation I though you were teasing with me 
[22:13:24] <zetok> nah
[22:13:27] <dreadpirate> as my nick also contains the 'pirate'
[22:13:28] <dreadpirate> lol
[22:13:32] <dreadpirate> yup
[22:13:34] <zetok> I wanted to get pirate translation in qTox for years
[22:13:36] <dreadpirate> I realize it now
[22:13:57] <dreadpirate> forgive my ignorance, but what's a pirate translation then?
[22:14:09] <zetok> um, have you had a look on the website?
[22:15:08] <dreadpirate> ah
[22:15:14] <dreadpirate> I realize now
[22:15:26] <dreadpirate> "keep up with yer mates"
[22:15:26] <dreadpirate> lol
[22:15:31] <dreadpirate> funny
[22:15:31] <dreadpirate> ehe
[22:16:19] <dreadpirate> btw
[22:16:41] <dreadpirate> I just notice that this page is not the same as the page I initially landed - tox.chat
[22:16:48] <zetok> yep
[22:16:50] <dreadpirate> why the difference?
[22:16:55] <dreadpirate> is that a fork?
[22:17:01] <zetok> https://qtox.github.io/blog/2016/08/10/Hello-World.html
[22:18:50] <dreadpirate> tell me somethinf
[22:18:53] <dreadpirate> ..something
[22:19:17] <zetok> dreadpirate: have you had a look at the blog link?
[22:19:27] <dreadpirate> from what I read it seems that no one is maintaing the chat.tox then
[22:19:35] <dreadpirate> not yet
[22:21:05] <dreadpirate> well
[22:21:11] <dreadpirate> that explains :|
[22:21:13] <dreadpirate> damn 
[22:21:46] <dreadpirate> that's why so many good projects stalls
[22:22:11] <dreadpirate> I did not know anything about it
[22:22:25] <dreadpirate> actually I landed on the github page by chance
[22:22:34] <dreadpirate> and installed my qtox version from there
[22:23:55] <zetok> mm
[22:24:16] <zetok> qTox could make use of some better "public relations"
[22:24:49] <zetok> i.e. links to stuff being posted in places
[22:25:21] <dreadpirate> I concur
