[19:57:27] <Diadlo> #3866 What you think about add `password strength` to the `create profile` description?
[19:58:24] <Diadlo> When user will click `Tab` after password confirmation, if password not-empty, screen reader can say it
[19:58:39] <Diadlo> s/it/password strength/
[19:58:52] <zetok> um
[19:59:01] <zetok> sounds good
[19:59:07] <zetok> (I think?)
[19:59:29] <Diadlo> I can add it, if you don't want to work with C++ :)
[19:59:47] <zetok> ok
[20:04:20] <zetok> I've rebased #3866, going afk, if you want feel free to --ff-only it
[20:08:15] <Diadlo> zetok: In #3878 you writed, that on some systems fonts can look bad. Do we have this in issues? Does it fixes the problem? Also, comment seems redundant to me, cause it describe your changes, but ~not the code
[20:10:56] <zetok> >Do we have this in issues?
[20:10:57] <zetok> nope
[20:11:02] <zetok> >Does it fixes the problem?
[20:11:03] <zetok> no idea
[20:11:22] <zetok> and the code is fine
[20:11:30] <Diadlo> So, what is the reason of this changes?)
[20:11:39] <zetok> i.e. the code worked just fine for like 2 years, then there was some regression
[20:12:15] <zetok> and while it worked, it was close to the beginning of `main()`
[20:12:22] * zetok shrugs
[20:12:30] <zetok> feel free to debug it properly
[20:13:06] <Diadlo> I can't debug it, because I can't reproduce it
[20:13:16] <zetok> on windows?
[20:13:21] <zetok> or FreeBSD?
[20:13:27] <Diadlo> I haven't
[20:13:29] <Diadlo> Both
[20:13:36] <zetok> oh
[20:13:37] <zetok> :f
[20:13:47] <zetok> do you have agilob on qTox?
[20:14:01] <Diadlo> Nope :|
[20:14:13] <zetok> he complained that font in qTox on FreeBSD got worse some time ago
[20:14:43] <Diadlo> Can he test PR?
[20:14:46] <zetok> I'll ask him to test the PR
[20:15:04] <Diadlo> Ok
[20:16:41] <Diadlo> #3880 <- Does it means, that travis will build always 1 build?
[20:16:54] <zetok> um?
[20:17:07] <zetok> it builds only branches that are mentioned there
[20:17:17] <zetok> (tags are treated like branches)
[20:18:08] <Diadlo> But all your tags is in master, aren't they?
[20:18:28] <Diadlo> *our
[20:18:37] <zetok> nope
[20:18:42] <Diadlo> Wow. Why?
[20:18:44] <zetok> (doesn't really work like that)
[20:19:07] <Diadlo> AFAIK, tag is like a branch
[20:19:15] <zetok> there you go :)
[20:20:02] <zetok> branch A and B
[20:20:03] <Diadlo> Which our tag is not a part of master?
[20:20:15] <zetok> both contain commit asdf1
[20:20:22] <zetok> travis is set to build branch A
[20:20:33] <zetok> why would it build branch B even if it has the same commit?
[20:20:59] <Diadlo> There is no reason
[20:21:12] <zetok> same goes for tags
[20:22:15] <Diadlo> Oh. We use travis to make possible to get night-build?
[20:22:45] <zetok> perhaps we could
[20:23:01] <Diadlo> Or what the reason to build asdf1 twice?)

[20:37:31] <sudden6> Diadlo: what does #3871 exactly do?
[20:40:14] <Diadlo> Do you know, that <tab> click in gui switches current control?

[20:45:26] <Diadlo> Np :)
[20:48:18] <sudden6> I thought you were speaking about the tabs (registers?) at the top
[20:48:36] <Diadlo> No
[20:48:41] <Diadlo> Tab button
[20:49:11] <Diadlo> It changes active element in window
[20:49:14] <sudden6> mhm, in German and English? Tab has a double meaning^^

[20:58:56] <FaTony> hi, I'm trying to install qTox on Debian Testing and it doesn't seem to work, I have a version from tox.chat repo but when I try to update, it unticks the package and doesn't want to update
[20:59:01] <FaTony> help?
[21:02:22] <sudden6> FaTony: use the Open Build Service Repo mentioned on https://github.com/qTox/qTox
[21:03:05] <FaTony> that's how I'm trying to update it
[21:03:12] <sudden6> zetok: IIRC there was something special about Debian testing, do you remember what it was?
[21:03:42] <zetok> sudden6: now there's nothing special :D
[21:04:05] <sudden6> ah :)
[21:04:29] <zetok> FaTony: `ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d` ?
[21:04:33] <sudden6> FaTony: you need to remove the old tox.chat repo and add the one from here: https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Aantonbatenev%3Atox&package=qtox
[21:04:41] <FaTony> oh, I've re added repo and it seems to work, I'm not sure why it didn't before
[21:05:00] <zetok> k
[21:06:02] <FaTony> I guess the conflict with tox.chat repo
[21:09:04] <Diadlo> Guys, do we have issue like this: `opening chat after closing it in separated window, again separated `?
[21:10:24] <sudden6> Do you mean it opens separate after closing it or it should open separate after closing it?
[21:10:58] <zetok> Diadlo: IIRC nope
[21:11:01] <Diadlo> It was the idea of issue. Full description is too long :)
[21:11:47] <Diadlo> I mean, it should be separated before closing
[21:15:25] <sudden6> nope, I don't think we have an issue like that
[21:16:07] <Diadlo> It will be issue in zetok style ;)
[21:16:24] <Diadlo> 9 steps to reproduce
