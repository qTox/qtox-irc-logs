[04:14:11] <errorHelpMe> hello, anyone up?
[04:15:06] <errorHelpMe> I installed qTox in antergos+xfce and UI is completely messed up. Everything is oversized basically. Anyone knows what's up with that?

[10:53:28] <sudden6> zetok: want to fixup https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3876 ?
[10:53:51] <zetok> sudden6: not yet
[10:54:06] <sudden6> why not?
[10:54:33] <zetok> I don't even know if qTox supports that
[10:54:44] <sudden6> ohh
[10:55:10] <zetok> i.e. it's been long since I've forgotten about the UI for toxme integration when I've tested it
[10:55:30] <zetok> and I don't really feel like registering a bogus account only to find out that I can't remove it
[10:55:50] <sudden6> can't you remove it via the website anyway?
[10:56:01] <zetok> nope
[10:56:14] <sudden6> IIRC there's some key/password where you can do this
[10:56:20] <zetok> not quite
[10:56:31] <zetok> website functionality ≠ API functionality
[10:57:34] <sudden6> that's sad
[10:57:46] <zetok> i.e. website does give you a password when registering, but when you're using the API, you're expected to use SK to later manage the entry
