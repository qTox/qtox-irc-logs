[19:50:43] <Diadlo> Yes. Seems, {} better
[19:50:48] <Diadlo> I was wrong
[19:51:07] <Diadlo> It's feature of new standard
[19:51:10] <zetok> Diadlo: not really, I was just wondering if perhaps you know
[19:51:29] <Diadlo> Nope :(
[19:52:52] <sudden6> Diadlo: could you enlighten me, what it does or how this feature is called? I forgot to ask^^
[19:53:36] <Diadlo> sudden6:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18222926/why-is-list-initialization-using-curly-braces-better-than-the-alternatives#18222927
[19:55:34] <sudden6> thx, interesting, C++ seems to let go of it's C roots
[19:55:49] <Diadlo> Yes, it is
[19:57:46] <zetok> lol
[19:58:19] <sudden6> Diadlo: I rebased, waiting for lgtm
[20:02:12] <Diadlo> sudden6: IDK, what about adding some history backup?
[20:02:39] <Diadlo> May be show dialog
[20:02:57] <sudden6> hm
[20:03:07] <zetok> history backup sounds nice
[20:03:39] <sudden6> so a backup before upgrading?
[20:04:09] <zetok> yep
[20:04:19] <sudden6> will do
[20:04:58] <zetok> `.db.backup-$commit` ?
[20:10:04] <sudden6> zetok: I was thinking about just .db.bak
[20:10:28] <zetok> mm
[20:10:32] <sudden6> this would be a ~one liner
[20:10:56] <zetok> is commit stuff not accessible from settings?
[20:12:49] <sudden6> I don't think so, but you gave me a nice idea
[20:15:08] <sudden6> zetok: should we still try upgrading the db if the backup fails?
[20:15:17] <sudden6> I don't think so
[20:15:40] <zetok> sudden6: we should provide a pop-up window with a link to make an issue
[20:15:55] <zetok> sudden6: issue with pre-filled content
[20:15:58] <sudden6> zetok: code wise that would be horrible
[20:17:49] <sudden6> since I'd just copy the file, the most probable reason a backup would fail is out of disk space and I suppose this will cause problems elsewhere pretty fast
[20:21:23] <zetok> oh wait
[20:21:30] <zetok> >should we still try upgrading the db if the backup fails?
[20:21:31] <zetok> no
[20:21:59] <zetok> sudden6: sorry, I've misread that as "should we try upgrading again if upgrading fails"

[21:01:44] <sudden6> whew
[21:02:17] <Diadlo> I'm trying to cherry-pick commit from ui/redesign
[21:03:20] <sudden6> good luck
[21:03:36] <sudden6> Is there a reason why antis81 squashed everything into one change
[21:04:28] <sudden6> hmm, travis OSX backlog is already increasing...
[21:05:06] <zetok> one commit is probably easier to rebase
[21:05:31] <sudden6> could be, but makes the cherry picking changes a nightmare...
[21:10:46] * sudden6 now running Rust 1.13
[21:12:19] <zetok> https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/5e5n1m/riot_open_source_slack_alternative_built_on/ ← anyone interested in commenting about qTox/Tox ?
[21:12:34] <zetok> which provide Real™ crypto
[21:30:03] <sudden6> zetok: how can I get the last n bytes of an array of length n in Rust?
[21:30:20] <sudden6> s/length n/length x/
[21:30:44] <zetok> array[array.len()-n..]
[21:30:56] <zetok> you probably want a slice though
[21:31:06] <zetok> i.e. add `&` before it
[21:31:50] <sudden6> ah, nice
[22:02:03] <sudden6> zetok: thx, another question, is there an easy method to make a uint64 out of n <= 8 bytes?
[22:02:13] <sudden6> besides the shift and add way
[22:02:22] <zetok> :|
[22:03:36] <zetok> https://zetok.github.io/tox/tox/toxcore/binary_io/fn.array_to_u64.html ← there's this
[22:03:44] <zetok> alternatively, you could use a crate
[22:03:52] <zetok> sec, lemme find its name
[22:04:11] <sudden6> zetok: no thx
[22:04:19] <sudden6> then the shift and add way is easier
[22:04:30] <zetok> sudden6: https://crates.io/crates/byteorder
[22:04:56] <sudden6> I thought maybe there's some way to restructure the bytes like a slice or something
[22:04:56] <zetok> byteorder is the proper™ way
[22:05:08] <zetok> there is
[22:05:32] <zetok> but it doesn't produce same results on different archs
[22:05:52] <zetok> hence the byteorder crate

[22:26:08] <Diadlo> And on v1.6.0
[22:27:10] <zetok> Diadlo: I did, and it seemed to work :|
[22:27:29] <zetok> if it's reproducible, then nvm

[22:28:27] <zetok> if there is only 1 participant in the groupchat, there is no call
[22:29:02] <Diadlo> Yes. But, what the bug?
[22:29:08] <zetok> oh
[22:29:17] <zetok> Diadlo: um, what exactly did you reproduce?
[22:29:34] <zetok> green or black nick?
[22:29:38] <Diadlo> > By color of mute buttons?  <-- Mute button is green
[22:30:04] <zetok> Diadlo: the problem is that own nick is not colored green
[22:30:05] <Diadlo> And call button is disabled
[22:30:13] <zetok> nvm the call
[22:30:29] <Diadlo> This is known bug?
[22:31:06] <zetok> um
[22:31:27] <zetok> nick being black instead of green – no, I didn't know about it earlier

[22:32:28] <zetok> right, there's no need to
[22:32:33] <Diadlo> O_o
[22:32:35] <Diadlo> What?
[22:33:27] <zetok> Diadlo: how many participants are in the group?
[22:33:36] <Diadlo> 1

[22:36:30] <zetok> ok, and at that point it's not possible to make a call, since there are no participants
[22:36:35] <zetok> (not a bug)
