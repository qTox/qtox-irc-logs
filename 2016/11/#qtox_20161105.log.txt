[19:57:50] <Diadlo> zetok: About your PR
[19:57:59] <Diadlo> `git log --raw | tail -n +7 | head -n1` for me is empty line
[19:58:13] <zetok> hmm
[19:58:36] <Diadlo> May be +6 ?
[19:58:45] <zetok> could you provide output of `git log --raw 2b3eaa1`  ?
[19:59:07] <zetok> HEAD~1..HEAD that is
[19:59:19] <zetok> could you provide output of `git log --raw 2b3eaa1..55d1fbeb42e0e83fe6ef5af0441eac4eb3d82592`  ?
[19:59:22] <zetok> ↑ fixed
[19:59:38] <zetok> no, wait, the other way around >.<
[20:00:04] <zetok> git log --raw 55d1fbeb42e0e83fe6ef5af0441eac4eb3d82592..2b3eaa1

[20:00:11] <Diadlo> Not last :)
[20:01:04] <Diadlo> Hm...
[20:01:12] <Diadlo> For this commits it works
[20:01:19] <zetok> good :)

[21:56:15] <Diadlo> This PR will break all future PR
[21:59:12] <zetok> um?
[22:00:18] <Diadlo> Ok. Just check the link
[22:00:31] <zetok> I know that it errored
[22:00:54] <Diadlo> So, what the reason to create this PR?
[22:01:26] <zetok> to remember
[22:01:35] <zetok> and to merge once it will work
[22:02:20] <Diadlo> Lol. What about tasklist or something like that?
[22:02:23] <Diadlo> I'm against of open PR just `to remember`
[22:02:36] <zetok> that's basically the same
[22:02:37] <Diadlo> We already have 21 open PR
[22:02:53] <zetok> yeah, we would have less PRs if they were quickly reviewed & merged on time
[22:03:21] <zetok> + PR already has the code that is ~ready for merge when it could be merged
[22:03:46] <Diadlo> Do what you think is necessary
[22:05:55] <zetok> I could close the PR and open an issue, only later on to reopen PR..
[22:06:52] <zetok> also the downside of creating an issue is that I probably would forget about it long before we'd set Debian 9 as lowest supported version
[22:07:58] <Diadlo> If you think, that it's right -- leave this PR

[22:24:49] <zetok> it doesn't change the cursor for me, not sure if that's due to my config
[22:27:29] <Diadlo> Which button doesn't work for you?
[22:28:44] <zetok> all that I've tried
[22:28:49] <zetok> (all from the commit)
[22:29:01] <nurupo> zetok: i said that i would be busy for 24 hours in #toktok
[22:29:24] <zetok> nurupo: right, I just though that you would push the button already
[22:29:39] <nurupo> have you read #toktok?
[22:29:53] <nurupo> the text is not ready, i want to add stuff to it
[22:30:06] <nurupo> it's not "just push the button"
[22:30:13] <zetok> oh well
