[10:14:09] <zetok> maybe?
[10:14:30] <SkyzohKey> as it show only the package description on gnome-software i guess it doesn't have one
[10:15:35] <zetok> oh

[12:17:36] <SkyzohKey> tux3: I have no idea how to add the qTox.appdata.xml to your packages
[12:17:52] <SkyzohKey> it needs to be installed as /usr/share/appdata/qTox.appdata.xml
[12:18:27] <tux3> SkyzohKey, since I don't do the packages anymore, I'm not sure either :)

[16:41:17] <user69> Hi Everyone, Hope you are all well today.  I am using Linux Mint KDE 32-bit ver. 17.3 and testing ver. 18. On version 18 I copied my "qTox" folder to that so I would not loose my contacts and their authentications, but it always tell me that my chat logs are disabled and will be ignored? How can I resolve that, please. Also, I added another contact in my LM 18, how an I export that contact for importing into my LM 17.3 without having to reauthenticate? Thank 
[16:41:19] <user69> you all in advance for your help.
[16:53:44] <sudd3n6> user69: hi
[16:54:10] <sudd3n6> have you also copied the file ending with *.db?
[16:54:47] <sudd3n6> and which versions of qTox do you use on which os?
[17:01:46] <user69> sudd3n6: Thanks for replying. The whole "qtox" folder, including the db file. Linux Mint KDE are the OS's.
[17:02:31] <sudd3n6> user69: and which version of qTox? (displayed in the "About" tab)
[17:02:58] <user69> qTox version v1.5.2-obs.
[17:03:39] <user69> sudd3n6: qTox version v1.5.2-obs.
[17:03:45] <sudd3n6> is there anything special in the logs?
[17:04:21] <zetok> sudd3n6: um, what was the exact path to the dir?
[17:04:28] <zetok> uh, sorry
[17:04:31] <zetok> user69: ↑
[17:04:49] <user69> sudd3n6: what logs?
[17:05:38] <zetok> settings → Advanced → 
[17:05:47] <sudd3n6> user69: If you run `qtox` from a terminal it displays log output
[17:06:04] *** sudd3n6 is now known as sudden6
[17:06:12] <sudden6> or zetok's way^^
[17:06:34] <zetok> user69: also https://github.com/qTox/qTox/wiki/FAQ#how-to-merge-two-profiles-of-the-same-id-synchronize-contacts-and-history
[17:07:24] <user69> sudd3n6: The dir (folder path is my "/home/user69/.config/tox/")
[17:07:35] <zetok> ok
[17:08:40] <user69> sudden6: The only thing in my "Advanced" tab is the option to make qtox portable
[17:09:32] <user69> sudden6: and zetok: I am checking out that link now ....
[17:09:32] <sudden6> hm, there should be "Export Debug Log", but maybe that's only in 1.6
[17:09:59] <sudden6> user69: run qTox from a terminal and put the output on gist.github.com
[17:10:07] <sudden6> or some other paste site
[17:13:19] <user69> sudden6:  and or zetok: It woulod be nice to have an "export" contact with their authentication option. I am not sure that copying the ".db" file back to Linux Mint 17.3 from 18 is the way to go, unless you guys say so....
[17:14:41] <sudden6> user69: your contacts aren't stored in the db file, they are stored in the *.tox file, which will be hopefully reworked on the next toxcore release
[17:16:25] <sudden6> copying the *.tox file between different computers should work, on the *.db file I'm not sure...
[17:16:45] <sudden6> user69: to be safe create a backup of both before experimenting!
[17:18:27] <zetok> >which will be hopefully reworked on the next toxcore release
[17:18:33] <user69> sudden6:  thank you ... Yes, as I mentioned before, I copied the whole "tox" folder from my LM 17.3 to my LM 18 system but I get he caht logs disabled error everytime I start "qtox" on that system. then, I added a new contact thru LM 18 qtox, and i wanted to export that contact with authentication into my LM17.3 system's qtox
[17:18:39] <zetok> sudden6: that won't happen on the next release
[17:19:38] <user69> sudden6:  I alkways have good backups, but thank you for that advice..
[17:19:53] <sudden6> user69: you should be able to copy the *.tox file from your LM18 system to the LM17.3 system and have the contact there
[17:20:16] <sudden6> for the chat logs disabled error I need the output from qTox
[17:20:40] <user69> So, just export my qtox profile, or just copy it the ".tox" file?
[17:20:48] <zetok> user69: that's the same thing :)
[17:20:57] <user69> Got it...
[17:23:02] <user69> sudden6:  Thank you both for your help. And, please include in future releases and updates the ability to export authenticated contact either one at a time or all to some file that caqn be easily imported into qtox on another system, thank you.  Also, I had a feature request for allowing the user to resize the text entry, anything happening on that?
[17:23:26] <zetok> >And, please include in future releases and updates the ability to export authenticated contact either one at a time or all to some file that caqn be easily imported into qtox on another system, thank you.
[17:23:29] <zetok> not doable
[17:23:50] <zetok> i.e. it doesn't really work like that
[17:24:25] <zetok> what is required for communication between 2 people, is them knowing each others' PKs (part of Tox ID)
[17:24:55] <zetok> if you know someone's PK, and they know yours, you've got the "authentication" that you were thinking of
[17:25:21] <user69> zetok: OOC, out of curiosity, why not? In other messaging apps, I can resize the text entry, or in the option increase or decrease froom 2 line to whatever. When I was a software developer, you could usually just chage the attribut for that text entry box to allow user resize?
[17:25:41] <zetok> problem is that if you change your PK and friend doesn't know it, you can't communicate
[17:25:51] <zetok> user69: I was talking just about the quoted part
[17:26:49] <user69> Can't that be transmitted to the  other user when contact is made, or with each sent message?
[17:27:28] <zetok> that would be a horrible work-around
[17:27:40] <user69> just a thought..
[17:27:44] <zetok> which is not going to be needed once multiple devices are in place
[17:28:22] <zetok> so simply it's better to focus efforts on support for multiple devices, rather than on workarounds
[17:28:32] <zetok> user69: as for the feature request: https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/1316
[17:29:10] <user69> zetok:  I understand, thank you for your replies...
[17:29:18] <zetok> you're welcome :)
[17:30:29] <user69> I hope you all have a great day, or night, or both :)
[17:32:01] <zetok> user69: it would be good if you could provide the logs of the error
[17:33:37] <user69> I am currently in my Linux Mint 17.3 system with no errors, but when I boot to my LM 18 where I always get the "chat logs will disable messages, I will capture that, and get the to you.
[17:34:09] <zetok> ok, thanks :)
[17:34:37] <zetok> btw, have you checked if the setting for chat history is set?
[17:35:08] <zetok> https://a.uguu.se/PEcppUvcjSXK.png
[17:35:42] <zetok> IIRC it should be "on" by default, but perhaps something went wrong
[17:35:53] <user69> You are welcome. Yes, I have turned that on and off, but no go with that. And, thanks agin for a wonderful multi-media secure chat application. I recommend it often in the Linux Mint forums and to others.
[17:37:03] <user69> zetok: I am user "phd21" or "user69"
[17:37:32] <user69> zetok:  "phd21' in theLinux Mint forums, and "user69" using IRC
[17:39:58] <user69> zetok:  after reading those links, I wonder if sql light is not installed on my Linux Mint 18, so I will check that as well.
[17:41:14] <zetok> hmm, it should have been pulled in by the package
[17:42:27] <zetok> user69: `apt-cache depends qtox` ?
[17:43:13] <user69> Yeah, I though it was installed in Linux Mint by default, but a lot has changed  in Linux Mint 18 (ubuntu 16.04) vs Linux Mint 17.x (ubuntu 14.04).  I did not know if "qtox" would have installed that as a dependency or not...
[17:44:38] <user69> I'll check that... I don't see that in my Linux Mint 17.3 ....
[17:46:20] <user69> I did just see this from those results, "Conflicts: qtox-alpha"?
[17:47:47] <user69> I have installed "qtox awhile ago from the ".deb" file, and then installed the repo for this, then today I updated using a new ".deb" file....
[17:52:18] <user69> zetok: fyi: my email address is "phd21mint@gmail.com", and my qtox id is phd21 and is on the toxme.io
[17:53:24] <user69> Ok, gotta go for now. Thanks again for all your help and replying to my questions...

[21:05:34] <zetok> detached signature, yes
[21:05:47] <nurupo> oh, nevermind then
[21:06:34] <nurupo> i thought the signature was modifying the binary, so that Windows (tm) (r) would should that the application is not from an untrusted source but from a suchand such developer
[21:06:43] <nurupo> *would show
