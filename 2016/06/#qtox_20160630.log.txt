[09:33:39] <cisc> what is qTox relying on for the "Auto away after" feature on both Win and 'nix; I notice that when a PC is away that it shifts back and forth from yellow to green, there assuredly is no input being done on that computer so on PC 2 it should show PC 1's status as always away
[09:37:31] <zetok> native stuff
[09:38:19] <zetok> for linux, it's libxscreensaver, or whatever is its name
[09:38:55] <zetok> not sure if that's what you have there though
[09:40:13] * zetok wonders whether that's due to auto-away
[09:40:40] <zetok> cisc: is it reproducible without auto-away, and only with "Away" set manually?
[09:42:33] <cisc> when away is set manually from what I can tell with all the people on my FL, it stays 'away' but if someone has auto away set, then can be gone from the computer for 12 hours and it alternates between green and yellow, like it has a mind of its own but that computer is receiving absolutely no input
[09:42:54] <cisc>  /s/then/they
[09:42:58] <zetok> huh
[09:51:20] <zetok> cisc: https://github.com/tux3/qTox/issues/3327 ?
[09:52:55] *** Joins: abbat (~abbat@ )
[09:54:10] <cisc> zetok: no because I'm not sending any messages to them
[09:54:24] <zetok> cisc: yes, but perhaps someone else sent them a message?
[09:54:43] <cisc> the status light (they are running a Windows machine) will be yellow b/c of auto away, then goes green automatically but they are not doing any input on the PC
[09:55:02] <cisc> zetok: also no because for instance on person, he only has me and Echobot on his list
[09:55:14] <cisc>  /s/on/one
[09:55:38] <zetok> ok
[09:55:57] <cisc> does that ring any bells or new issue?
[09:56:10] <zetok> cisc: could you make a new issue for it, linking in it also to the other issue?
[09:56:23] <cisc> yeah
[09:56:27] <zetok> thanks
[09:56:32] <cisc> np
[09:56:50] <cisc> I haven't tested it w/ a Linux machine, I probably will

[17:54:55] <Saamm> Zetok : about the language choice of the website, I keep working on it. But I feel like what is displayed on my screen may not be displayed the same way for every user. So there will be slight corrections to do.
[17:55:38] <zetok> Saamm: you can test that by pushing website to (IIRC) `gh-pages` branch
[17:55:46] <Saamm> Moreover, I'm trying to put the flags of every languages too, but for some of them, I'm gonna need some help
[17:56:44] <Saamm> Yep, you're right. I've started to learn yesterday about how to use GitHub, I've installed Git, but for now I'm not entirely into it
[17:57:41] <Saamm> About the languages, I see there's a "<a href="{{{lang_shortcode}}}.html">{{{lang_name}}}</a>" in the code, but I've to find the file where the "lang_shortcode" and "lang_name" is displayed...
[17:57:49] <Saamm> Sorry, I'm not very clear :/
[17:58:09] <zetok> it's not
[17:58:33] <zetok> it's replaced by pystache
[17:59:27] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox-Website/blob/master/buildsite.py#L45,L62
[18:00:02] <Saamm> Anyway, for my Git teach, I tried to create a repo, to commit, etc., but even if everything goes well on my computer, "nothing" happen in my online account. I'll have to focus on that.
[18:00:14] <Saamm> Thanks for pystache
[18:00:24] <zetok> yeah, git is decentralized
[18:00:38] <zetok> i.e. until you push to remote server, your local changes are only local
[18:01:29] <zetok> um, which OS are you using?
[18:02:32] <Saamm> Windows 7
[18:02:36] <zetok> uh
[18:02:53] <zetok> sorry, no idea how to use git on that
[18:02:55] <Saamm> disappointed? :p
[18:03:10] <Saamm> Hehe, don't worry, I'm gonna follow tutorials
[18:03:42] <zetok> um, it's not really about me being disappointed; it's just that using git on windows appears to be overly hard
[18:04:21] <Saamm> Challenge accepted. 8)
[18:06:02] *** Quits: abbat (~abbat@ ) (Remote host closed the connection)
[18:06:13] <Saamm> Jokes appart, to tell the truth, I'd like to have someone to make me understand the way the languages works on the website. I will try to understand that python file buildsite.py for now.
[18:06:42] <zetok> well, there are 2 things
[18:06:50] <zetok> buildsite.sh & buildsite.py
[18:06:57] <Saamm> Because yeah, there are several things I never saw before... That's a whole new way to display a website for me, I'm not used to that
[18:07:13] <zetok> buildsite.py was the only thing, using pystache (mustache) to create files from template & replace all strings
[18:07:14] <Saamm> yup
[18:08:23] <zetok> sadly, mustache is broken when it comes to "key" values in json having dots, so I've written sterminator, and added buildsite.sh that first runs buildsite.py and then sterminator on files that buildsite.py created
[18:09:45] <zetok> thus, currently buildsite.py only generates files from template & replaces language section in generated files
[18:10:54] <zetok> I was wondering whether to not remove buildsite.py completely, but it worked for generating files & replacing language section, so I don't really see point in replacing something that works
[18:11:53] <zetok> um, about buildsite.py – I understand the general idea behind it, but since I don't really know python, I'm afraid that I can't really help with it
[18:12:21] <zetok> as for building website – one has to run `buildsite.sh`
[18:12:30] <zetok> oh wait
[18:12:47] <zetok> since you have windows, you'd have to compile sterminator & put it in path
[18:14:15] <zetok> hmm
[18:14:39] <Saamm> I'd have to compile sterminator... Oô
[18:16:51] <Saamm> Btw, I never developped programs. I only know a bit of HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL (and the basic part of JS)
[18:17:36] <Saamm> The only compilations I've done was this year with small C programs, nothing more :3
[18:17:51] <zetok> compiling native Rust programs is easy
[18:18:06] <zetok> `cargo build` and that's it
[18:18:29] <zetok> https://www.rust-lang.org/
[18:20:53] <zetok> btw, is there a point in learning JS when one can compile Rust to JS, and soon™ to asmjs?
[18:21:36] <Saamm> Aaaaand another thing to learn X)
[18:24:11] <Saamm> thank you, by the way, for your patience ;)
[18:25:17] <zetok> no problem :)

[21:01:26] <zetok> PHP shouldn't be used anyway

[21:04:16] <zetok> um, I don't really know about webdev, but it seemed like something not doable, given the constraints – I just hoped that I might be wrong, given my lack of knowledge
[21:07:12] <Saamm> I hope that someone will know how to do that
[21:08:31] <zetok> probably not doable
[21:08:54] <zetok> i.e. to do something dynamically, you'd need js, or something other running code
[21:12:57] <Saamm> In fact, I was just thinking of an URL-check. If there's for example "it.html", the default flag would be the italian onne
