[10:01:53] <Saaam_> Hello everyone ^^  I have this friend who installed qTox on her computer, and she asked me if there was a mobile version (andro√Ød) ?
[10:02:09] <oranges> no there is not a mobile qtox version
[10:02:21] <oranges> at least I don't think so
[10:02:46] <oranges> there is another client called Antox
[10:02:52] <oranges> that works with qtox and other tox clients
[10:03:07] <oranges> you have to get it on google play beta or somethign though
[10:05:26] <Saaam_> Thank you  ;)

[14:35:18] <Diadlo> Hello
[14:35:30] <Diadlo> I have some problem with new build
[14:36:19] <Diadlo> g++ ... qrc_smileys.cpp    virtual memory exhausted: Unable to allocate memory
[14:36:40] <Diadlo> du -h qrc_smileys.cpp     =>    32M qrc_smileys.cpp
[14:37:00] <Diadlo> For old builds is 9.6M
[14:37:38] <zetok> huh
[14:39:51] <zetok> oh
[14:39:53] <zetok> right
[14:40:11] <zetok> thanks for making me look at htop, I didn't notice the memleak
[14:42:30] <zetok> Diadlo: posted, could that memleak have something to do with it?
[14:43:46] <zetok> Diadlo: how much memory does it want to use?
[14:45:04] <Diadlo> ~800M
[14:45:29] <zetok> :s
[14:46:56] <zetok> Diadlo: as a workaround you could add swap
[14:47:05] <zetok> how much RAM do you have?
[14:48:31] <zetok> # `fallocate -l 2G ./swapfile && chmod 600 ./swapfile && mkswap ./swapfile && swapon ./swapfile` IIRC
[14:48:32] <Diadlo> 2G
[14:48:53] <zetok> Diadlo: also, it would be good if you opened an issue
[14:49:03] *** Joins: Diadl0 (~Diadlo@ )
[14:49:13] <zetok> AFAIK that's an upstream problem, but still..
[14:49:44] <Diadlo> I will test it later
[14:50:06] <Diadlo> Now my solution is close all application :)
