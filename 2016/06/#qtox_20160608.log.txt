[00:11:42] <oranges> &
[00:11:45] <Rowen_Stipe> After testing, you are correct; branch is ignored and when ever a tag is appliede to any branch a deployment will be created
[00:12:55] <Rowen_Stipe> zetok: ^
[00:13:31] <zetok> oh, so you don't have to push tag & commit at the same time?
[00:13:43] <Rowen_Stipe> Correct
[00:13:48] <zetok> ok
[00:14:23] <zetok> PR update?
[00:14:32] <Rowen_Stipe> I'm gonna update my other PR to include tux3's API key and uncomment everything else involved with deployment.
[00:14:49] <Rowen_Stipe> And then yes, PR update
[00:14:54] <zetok> thanks :)
[00:16:39] <zetok> looks like it'll be time for 1.4.2, special osx release, after special 1.4.1 windows release >.<

[00:19:53] <Rowen_Stipe> PR updated
[00:31:15] <Rowen_Stipe> I'm kinda sad now because the running joke I've had going for the qTox OS X releases about it not making waffles will be dead.
[00:36:48] <zetok> :c
[00:37:05] <Rowen_Stipe> That is unless someone edits the release tag.
[00:37:16] <zetok> Rowen_Stipe: could you squash that last commit?
[00:38:08] <Rowen_Stipe> Yeah.
[00:40:34] * zetok wonders
[00:40:58] <zetok> 1.4.2 probably isn't a good idea, since it doesn't actually change any code :s
[00:41:08] <zetok> i.e. qTox code
[00:41:28] <Rowen_Stipe> what about 1.4.1.2 ?
[00:41:38] <zetok> 1.4.1.1 ?
[00:41:44] <Rowen_Stipe> Sure
[00:42:08] * zetok wonders about 1.4.1.0
[00:43:33] <Rowen_Stipe> would just be 1.4.1 it's self then.

[18:19:37] <zetok> right, sorry, osx release did that

[18:22:56] <zetok> LittleVulpix: to be precise, it started ~17h ago for your friend, right?

[18:33:27] <LittleVulpix> zetok: Hard to say, maybe it started earlier and he just complained about it today :p

[19:50:16] <zetok> PafXUS: um, do you know how to rebase PR?
[19:50:35] <PafXUS> not really
[19:50:40] <zetok> I see
[19:52:26] <zetok> ok
[19:52:39] <zetok> PafXUS: `git rebase -i 7b34625`
[19:53:06] <zetok> before that, you might want to make a backup branch
[19:53:14] <zetok> `git branch backup`
[19:53:46] <zetok> PafXUS: once editor with rebase will show up, save what you see and close it
[19:54:11] <zetok> after that, commits should be rebased, and there should be no merge commit in `git log`
[19:54:36] <zetok> PafXUS: um, if something isn't clear, please say so
[19:54:55] <PafXUS> just started to use git, so thats all new stuff for me. What rebase will give?
[19:55:18] <zetok> depending on the kind of rebase you're doing
[19:55:37] <zetok> generally, rebase applies some commits on top of other commits
[19:55:56] <zetok> but with interactive rebase `-i` you can do a lot more, e.g. rewrite history
[19:56:33] *** Joins: Chiitoo (~Chiitoo@ )
[19:58:17] <zetok> so simple rebase in this case when all commits are picked will simply remove unneeded merge commit
[19:58:40] <PafXUS> so it shows 4 picks and commented out help text
[19:58:56] <zetok> yep, save that & exit from editor
[20:00:47] <zetok> now merge commit should be gone from `git log`
[20:00:53] <zetok> is that the case?
[20:04:09] <PafXUS> hmm i can still se it in git log, what i've done wrong?
[20:04:45] <zetok> is there `Rebasing (4/4)` in terminal output?
[20:05:06] <zetok> oh
[20:05:25] <PafXUS> it asked my gpg key 4 times, and yea it showed 4/4

[20:20:13] <zetok> `git rebase --continue`

[20:36:31] <zetok> oh, right, now you can remove `backup` branch: `git branch -D backup`
[20:37:11] <zetok> and since you'll need a new branch to work on stuff, to create a local branch based on upstream master: `git checkout upstream/master -b local_branch`

[20:38:23] <zetok> uh
[20:39:14] <PafXUS> i really should take some book on git, and read it) because now that's look like some spells 
[20:39:29] <zetok> what you need is `man git`
[20:40:00] <zetok> + other git-command manuals
[20:40:04] <zetok> + practice
[20:40:40] <PafXUS> yea, you right) but for now, what is other rebase is happening? should i abort it?
[20:40:46] <zetok> yeah
[20:40:52] * zetok wonders if it would work
[20:41:12] <zetok> btw, after you do that, manually remove /home/user/work/qTox/.git/rebase-merge
[20:41:44] <zetok> are commits on your local `master` intact?
[20:42:09] <PafXUS> there is no such thing
[20:42:43] <zetok> file or commits?
[20:43:29] <PafXUS> inside .git no rebase-merge
[20:43:45] <zetok> that's fine
[20:44:03] <PafXUS> sorry, i must go now for like 10-20 min, thanks alot for your help
[20:44:18] <zetok> you're welcome :)
[20:46:46] <PafXUS> btw why travis build failed on my pull request?
[20:47:26] <zetok> https://github.com/tux3/qTox/blob/master/.travis.yml#L8
[20:47:35] <zetok> i.e. commits have to conform
[20:47:58] <zetok> https://github.com/tux3/qTox/blob/master/verify-commit-messages.sh#L32 ;)
[20:52:57] <zetok> um, if the question was about why exactly, then it's because merge commits made by github don't conform to commit message format used by qTox
[21:17:25] <zetok> PafXUS: btw, you might want to add `default-cache-ttl 360` in ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
[21:17:52] <zetok> + set other things needed, since constantly typing password is meh

[22:28:13] <sudden6> zetok: is there a file describing our markdown syntax anywhere?
[22:28:25] <zetok> ~nope
[22:28:30] <zetok> oh wait
[22:28:44] <zetok> IIRC there should be something in user manual..?
[22:28:59] <zetok> https://github.com/tux3/qTox/blob/master/doc/user_manual_en.md#message-styling
[22:29:06] <sudden6> no I mean the markdown style we use to write things like the user manual
[22:29:35] <zetok> >.<
[22:29:44] <zetok> ok, that's what my first sentence was about
[22:29:58] <zetok> but then I thought that you meant qTox's "markdown"
[22:30:21] <sudden6> ok, but I remember some discussion about this
[22:30:41] <zetok> yeah
[22:30:44] <sudden6> and I'd like not to break already established formating^^
[22:31:47] <zetok> spaces, 4 of them, 80 chars per line
