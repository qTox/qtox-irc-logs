[05:05:48] <anoa> Still getting crashes on qTox, when Loading a profile from a file and now just when logging in.
[05:06:08] <anoa> Only from the git version, not the current stable release.
[05:23:21] <anoa> Interesting, so it's not crashing, it's just a 100% CPU usage in one core. Might be stuck in an infinite loop or something.
[05:37:32] <anoa> It was an infinite loop.
[05:44:37] <anoa> Fixed, woo.

[16:55:32] <rkzzy> Can someone help me confirm a crash in qTox?
[16:55:57] <rkzzy> On windows 7, latest qTox, start qTox, then right click on the tray icon, select logout, observe crash.

[20:36:07] <sudden6> ?
[20:39:03] <zetok> is is really better to wait for more commits, rather than merging what is already good for merge?
[20:39:13] <zetok> s/is is/is it/
[20:39:43] <sudden6> specific PR you think of?
[20:39:44] <zetok> re https://github.com/tux3/qTox/pull/3411
[20:40:03] *** Joins: LittleVulpix (~Miranda@ )
[20:41:04] <sudden6> I think so, because then everything in this PR can be tested against the specific errors that could happen
[20:41:22] <sudden6> mainly memory leaks
[20:41:39] <sudden6> or similar things
[20:45:26] <zetok> I'm looking at the PRs and I got this feeling that there'll be a lot of conflicts
[20:46:16] *** Joins: abbat (~Anton@ )
[20:47:22] <zetok> making PRs bigger than the bare minimum doesn't seem to help with that
[21:18:59] <sudden6> hmm, I still think it's easier to review if we keep the things together
