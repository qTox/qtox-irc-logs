[10:40:42] <Grokafar> Thanks zetok !
[10:41:00] <Grokafar> tux3: I'm trying to implement auto accept call feature
[10:43:48] <Grokafar> When I run the fonction CoreAv::answerCall() directly the condition " if (threadSwitchLock.test_and_set(std::memory_order_acquire))" fails... I'm not familiar with multhreading, I think I missunderstand something :/
[10:47:47] <tux3> So the coreav threading is fairly complicated
[10:47:59] <tux3> From what function are you calling answerCall() ?
[10:49:34] <Grokafar> from ChatForm::onAvInvite()
[10:50:52] <tux3> Okay, so onAvInvite is called directly from the toxcore call callback
[10:51:27] <tux3> And it's not allowed to run CoreAv functions like answerCall from a toxcore callback, because it could cause a deadlock and freeze qTox
[10:51:37] <tux3> So that conditon forces the function to return, to prevent a deadlock
[10:52:29] *** Joins: abbat (~abbat@ )
[10:53:18] <tux3> Instead, send an asynchronous event to the answerCall slot, using QMetaObject::invokeMethod
[10:54:21] *** Joins: anoa (~rainbow@ )
[10:54:52] <anoa> Any idea why qTox would suddenly compile and run normally, but upon logging in doesn't display a window?
[10:55:58] <tux3> Hard to tell, it could be a number of things
[10:56:04] <tux3> Do you have multiple screens?
[10:56:17] <anoa> Yes, although this hasn't been a problem in the past.
[10:56:41] <anoa> It's likely something outside of qTox though, as compiling based on the same commit earlier gave expected results.
[10:58:00] <Grokafar> thanks tux3 I gonna try this :)
[10:58:02] <tux3> anoa, I know Qt has some problems with multiple screens, try deleting the ~/.config/tox/qtox.ini
[10:58:09] <tux3> Grokafar, ok!
[10:58:25] <anoa> tux3: No dice.
[10:58:55] <anoa> Can someone test the implementation of this PR? https://github.com/tux3/qTox/pull/3441

[11:24:57] <Grokafar> tux3: I tried you method but it still doesn't work :/ the condition fail and then answerCall return false immediatly
[11:26:16] <tux3> Grokafar, have you tried something like this: QMetaObject::invokeMethod(toxav, "answerCall", Qt::QueuedConnection, Q_ARG(uint32_t, friendNum)); ?
[11:27:24] <Grokafar> tux3: yep exactly
[11:31:23] <tux3> That's very strange
[11:32:02] <tux3>   invokeMethod should ensure answerCall runs in the CoreAV thread, so the threadSwitchLock condition should not be reached
[11:32:17] <Grokafar> tux3: ow my bad, that's work the problem came from another place !
[11:32:22] <Grokafar> tux3: thanks a lot!

[18:08:40] <toweI> Diadlo, I created a new log file with 2 mb size and I get the same error
[18:11:51] <Diadlo> Ok. Let's try create simple application, which will rename file :)
[18:12:53] <toweI> tux3, we have critical errors https://github.com/tux3/qTox/issues/3440 qtox is doomed. :)
[18:19:58] <Diadlo> toweI, Can you compile this code http://pastebin.com/JbS5XE87 ?
[18:20:40] <tux3> Maybe Qt expects QDir::rename to refer to a relative path inside the folder? I'd try with static QFile::rename and see if it changes anything
[18:21:25] <tux3> (Or remove the "logFileDir + " prefix)
[18:22:31] <toweI> Diadlo, what command do I need?
[18:22:44] <toweI> to use qt
[18:24:53] <Diadlo> Easy way: wipe content of main function of qtox and paste new code instead of it :)
[18:28:52] <toweI> lol
[18:29:10] <toweI> sounds like a nice lighweight programm now

[18:36:15] <toweI> Diadlo, shall I just feed the qtos log path?
[18:36:19] <toweI> with your program
[18:36:52] <toweI> oh it works without arguments
[18:37:01] <Diadlo> You shall just start this program)
[18:37:02] <Diadlo> Yes
[18:37:13] <toweI> Diadlo, I now have a qtox.log.1 instead of qtox.log
[18:37:22] <Diadlo> O_o
[18:37:49] <Diadlo> I little bit confused
[18:39:41] <toweI> why? was this expected to not work?
[18:39:51] <toweI> not to*
[18:40:05] <Diadlo> Yes
[18:40:31] <Diadlo> Ok
[18:40:43] <Diadlo> Restore code of main function :)
[18:41:02] <Diadlo> I have an idea
[18:41:46] <Diadlo> Move 182-184 lines at 170 line
[18:43:36] <tux3> Diadlo, oh yeah your idea is right. Windows can't rename open files ...
[18:43:46] <tux3> Nice find
[18:44:25] <Diadlo> Will be good, if it's true :)
[18:46:03] <Diadlo> tux3, Interesting, how *nix rename opened file :)
[18:46:34] <tux3> It's so useful, always annoying that windows can't!
[18:50:09] <toweI> windows disallows any modification if it is opened elsewhere
[18:50:27] <toweI> on file system perspective
[18:50:54] <Diadlo> toweI, Now problem fixed?)
[18:51:10] <toweI> I just read it
[18:51:31] <toweI> trying now to compile
[18:52:58] <toweI> Diadlo, what file was it?
[18:53:14] <Diadlo> main.cpp
[18:54:45] <toweI> Diadlo, you mean I shall move line 182 -184 to 170?
[18:55:06] <Diadlo> Yes. closing file before remove/rename
[19:03:42] <toweI> Diadlo, works
[19:04:03] <Diadlo> Great :)
[19:04:14] <Diadlo> Can you create PR?
[19:05:36] <toweI> is it supposed to delete the .log1 file when .log if full again?
[19:06:24] <toweI> from the log it looks like a yes
[19:06:33] <Diadlo> I think, it will be rewritten
