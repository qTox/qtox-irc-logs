[01:19:37] <tux3> zetok, people are making fun of our website!
[01:19:43] <tux3> Gotta work on web design
[01:22:01] <oranges> use oranges.net.nz/tox
[01:22:47] <tux3> oranges, I was expecting more memes, I'm almost disappointed!
[01:23:04] <oranges> what are memes?
[01:23:33] <tux3> >Magical amulets? Fake your own death? Move into a submarine? YOU'RE STILL GONNA BE MOSSAD'ED UPON
[01:23:34] <tux3> Kek
[01:25:06] <tux3> oranges, wow there's a form do date you in there?
[01:25:35] <tux3> It's asking my favorite meme, WHAT DO I SAY?
[01:25:38] <oranges> my friend made it for me after I criticised him for moving to australia to be with his gf
[01:26:04] <tux3> That's pretty sweet actually
[01:26:17] <oranges> you should see the responses
[01:26:19] <tux3> Pasta without sauce is a dealbreaker tho
[01:26:24] <oranges> I KNOW RIGHT
[01:26:26] <oranges> UGH I HATE IT
[01:26:36] <oranges> he only eats his pasta with nothing but a little cheese
[01:27:03] <tux3> Absolutely Disgusting.jpg
[01:27:27] <tux3> Not like I'm a word class cook, but I'm proud of my spaghetti skills..
[01:27:54] <oranges> I mean at least a simple white sauce
[01:27:55] <oranges> it's not even hard

[06:53:51] <nurupo> ><zetok> dunno about early though ‚Äì IMO people suffered long enough when using tox.chat <-- yeah, tox.chat could use quite a bit of improvements design and content-wise, as well as support of different languages
[06:58:09] <Chiitoo> Heh, the q.tox suggested could become true, almost.
[07:12:07] <nurupo> i don't think zetok would want q.tox.chat though, it seems like he doesn't want to associate with the tox.chat website
[07:15:14] <nurupo> ><zetok> tux3: ok, how do you feel about tox.chat misleading users about qTox in general, e.g. its availability on $platforms ? \ <zetok> solution to the problem is simply having own website with correct info

[12:25:23] <tux3> sudden6, hey!
[12:26:56] <sudden6> great you got around to making an org and website :)
[12:28:03] <tux3> You can  blame zetok :)
[12:28:20] <tux3> The org is actually a ~year old, we just never used it
[12:28:27] <sudden6> lol
[12:31:27] <sudden6> website looks pretty nice, but I think the "q" in the logo could use some bold
[12:32:17] <tux3> I was thinking the same, it's a shopped TOX logo with a q added in so it looks a bit strange!
[12:32:53] <zetok> bold
[12:32:58] <zetok> I knew it was missing something
[12:33:00] <zetok> >.<
[12:33:11] <sudden6> mhm, is there a svg source for the tox logo?
[12:33:20] <zetok> yep
[12:33:26] * zetok just edited .png
[12:33:47] <zetok> sudden6: btw, I'll be redoing website
[12:34:17] <sudden6> a set of logos would be nice I think, maybe someone will want to make some stickers
[12:34:34] <sudden6> then high quality logos are a win :)
[12:34:48] <zetok> sudden6: https://github.com/Tox/Tox-Logo
[12:37:10] <sudden6> thx
[12:37:32] <sudden6> I'll look if I can make a svg version of your logo
[12:37:50] <zetok> would be great :)
[12:38:01] <zetok> um, can just .svg be used on the website?
[12:38:24] <sudden6> no idea
[12:39:48] <sudden6> huh, inkscape can't open the file?
[12:40:17] <sudden6> forget it, I'm an idiot
[12:54:57] <zetok> https://gist.github.com/zetok/ea8159dd647b866a6a1c099711d84626 ‚Üê should perhaps joins/quits be also scrubbed?
[13:00:04] <zetok> ooh, looks like my regex missed one option
[13:01:30] <linuxmodder> zetok,  I'd say not 
[13:01:57] <linuxmodder> and scrub  nick changes or  vice verse
[13:07:56] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qtox-irc-logs/blob/master/2016/06/%23qtox_20160601.log.txt :)
[13:21:32] <linuxmodder> add a timezone mention in README.md  zetok   or  note they are all UTC or some such
[13:22:14] <linuxmodder> that way global users can  get a grasp of  timing in their  tz
[13:26:45] <zetok> done
[13:27:44] <linuxmodder> side note on github.io :   IRC has irc.freenode.net/qtox shouldn't it  be  #qtox 
[13:28:24] <zetok> it doesn't work?
[13:31:48] <linuxmodder> it does but  for someone that has no assocations in their  browser it is likely to be a shit show might consider adding  https://webchat.freenode.net/#qtox
[13:32:01] <linuxmodder> as well which opens as any  site would
[13:33:08] <zetok> mm
[13:33:43] <linuxmodder> belay that  it only  starts  mibbit for web users NOT a connect to channel and  freenode IS not  in that  list
[13:33:59] <linuxmodder> so its a full stop fail for a unaware user
[13:57:09] <sudden6> zetok: I couldn't get inkscape to work like I want :(
[13:57:18] <zetok> :c
[13:58:21] <sudden6> in theory it should be easy to copy the style of the Tox logo, but that program is driving me nuts
[13:58:35] * zetok knows the feel
[13:58:54] <zetok> that's why I've edited .png in krita
[13:59:43] <zetok> and if (when?) krita's newest kickstarter will be done, it will get real support for editing .svg \o/

[14:54:15] <zetok> hm.
[14:56:55] <zetok> >force pushing to master again
[14:56:57] <tux3> In my defense it's hard to test Jenkins changes before pushing..
[14:57:10] <zetok> bullshit
[14:58:11] <zetok> git diff > test.patch; patch -p1 < test.patch
[14:58:54] <tux3> And then I have to SSH to the build slave, and run the Jenkins script manually..
[14:58:58] <zetok> add to that `cat`, and you have test.patch on jenkins
[14:58:59] <tux3> Which is a *pain*
[14:59:03] <zetok> bullshit ;)
[14:59:11] <tux3> Heh
[14:59:27] <zetok> ><tux3> And then I have to SSH to the build slave, and run the Jenkins script manually..
[14:59:41] <zetok> also, you don't have to test jenkins by using `master`
[15:00:08] <zetok> unless you have broken builds I've set to test stuff on jenkins
[15:00:13] <zetok> it used `testing` branch
[15:00:33] <tux3> You're rigth that I could have made a new job and a new test branch
[15:00:37] <tux3> Maybe I'll do that next time
[15:00:53] <tux3> Still a pain tho
[15:00:55] <zetok> no, you could have just simply not have broken/removed job I've created for testing
[15:01:06] <zetok> then it would have "just worked"
[15:01:13] <tux3> ?
[15:01:57] <tux3> All the jobs have different scripts/dependencies/etc, it's faster to duplicate a job than to manually copy everything into your test job
[15:02:32] <zetok> yes and no
[15:02:47] <zetok> depends on use case :)
[15:02:56] <tux3> Heh

[15:05:03] <tux3> zetok, does it break because of force push?

[17:11:36] <ovalseven8> I don't want to rant but actually the most important thing is progress in qTox (fixing bugs [most important], new features, ...)
[17:14:55] <cisc> and the channel is being logged why?
[17:15:09] <zetok> cisc: "why not."
[17:15:24] <zetok> retention of knowledge
[17:16:15] <cisc> because it prevents people from saying certain things, not everyone wants every word in a channel logged
[17:17:21] <zetok> then they're doing it wrong by using IRC in the first place
[17:17:33] <zetok> if you're using IRC, it's logged
[17:17:53] <cisc> on someone's individual machine, yes
[17:18:28] <zetok> as for making those logs public ‚Äì that's just a kind gesture for people who can't be on IRC
[17:18:31] <cisc> there are reasons many channels aren't logged, for the reason I stated above

[21:36:49] <zetok> nurupo: um, if you could, please link to the Pirate language version
[21:37:39] <Lugarius> Well zetok. .. if the download button links to your github page, I would at least show the users the binary builds
[21:38:02] <Lugarius> I used openshot ( provides appimage)
[21:38:13] <zetok> I see :s
[21:38:28] <zetok> last time I've tried to use openshot, it just kept crashing
[21:38:40] <Lugarius> 2.x?

[21:40:14] <Lugarius> I don't know...by me it works all fine. .... well, tux3 ... how will this continue?
[21:42:38] <tux3> Lugarius, if static builds work well for everyone, we can start linking to them
[21:43:04] <tux3> For distributions that we don't build packages for, it's always easier than building from source
[21:44:44] <Lugarius> That a word. I can collect much non used distros.... if it works on small no name distros like 4mlinux or slitaz, it should work everywhere
[21:45:45] <zetok> they probably won't
[21:46:03] <tux3> Before it would crash for some people because of some Qt/X11 compatibility issue, so it might crash for some people that have an exotic version. If nobody reports a crash, then it's good
[21:46:17] <Lugarius> I tried to port an egoshooter appimage with no x11, it almost worked...
[21:46:49] <Lugarius> * to a distro with no x11
[21:47:27] <Lugarius> I will test,  I will test also Wayland / mir
[21:48:02] <Lugarius> ( mir should work because mir is build for QT
[21:49:06] <zetok> err, no
[21:50:31] <Lugarius> Canonical uses Qt to build software on mir ( ubuntu phone)...But now It have to sleep and let my post as it is. ..tomorrow ill update
[21:51:37] <zetok> canonical uses custom patches to make qt work under mir, or uses x11 compatibility layer, either option lowering chances of qTox just working‚Ñ¢
