[20:31:17] <Saamm> Hello everyone ^^
[20:53:11] <zetok> hello Saamm :)
[21:05:47] <Saamm> o/
[21:07:10] <zetok> Saamm: any progress with the website?
[21:08:04] <Saamm> yup
[21:08:09] <Saamm> I worked on it today
[21:08:12] <zetok> \o/
[21:08:40] <Saamm> But it currently doesn't do what I want... (CSS and positionning... such a pain in the a... >.<)
[21:09:02] <Saamm> So I still need to make it right
[21:09:14] <Saamm> But yeah, there are some progress ;)
[21:09:27] <zetok> that's great :)
[21:22:28] <vindelschtuffen> Saamm, got a repo?
[21:22:56] <Saamm> Excuse me but, what is a repo? ^^"
[21:24:05] <Saamm> (oh, by the way, I confirm the "no javascript needed")
[21:34:31] <Saamm> vindelschtuffen ?
[21:34:53] <vindelschtuffen> Saamm, the code you're working on, where is it hosted?
[21:35:09] <Saamm> Localhost ;)
[21:35:22] <Saamm> I dled the website to work on it on wamp
[21:35:48] <Saamm> (yeah, I'm not very familiar with github...) :/
[21:35:54] <Saamm> (so I do what I can)
[21:40:05] <vindelschtuffen> Cool, I'm interested in seeing your work :)
[21:41:02] <zetok> Saamm: https://try.github.io/
[21:42:46] <zetok> um, there seems to be a lot of stuff on the net about starting with git once you type 'git tutorial'
[21:42:54] <Saamm> Thanks ;)  I'll read that in few minutes ;)
[21:57:39] <zetok> btw, there's also a lot of github help pages that should explain things quite well
