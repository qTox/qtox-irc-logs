[05:17:14] <Se7en> I got the latest qtox binary
[05:17:16] <Se7en> I get the error
[05:17:17] <Se7en> qtox: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: version `CXXABI_1.3.8' not found (required by qtox)
[05:19:20] <Se7en> Anyone have the answer
[05:37:09] <oranges> install libstdc ?
[05:37:18] <oranges> well you probably have it
[05:37:23] <oranges> but no the 1.3.8 version
[05:37:25] <oranges> what is your os Se7en 
[05:38:16] <Se7en> Trisquel 7
[05:38:57] <Se7en> If I need to recompile the thing, can you link me te libstdc source?
[05:39:43] <Se7en> This is version 3
[05:39:47] <Se7en> Do I need 6?
[05:40:07] <Se7en> Oh.
[05:40:09] <oranges> version 3 of what?
[05:40:22] <oranges> the problem is that your C++ABI is either too new or too old
[05:40:23] <Se7en> I would need to recompile GCC to get the new libstdc?
[05:40:40] <oranges> what version of gcc do you have?
[05:41:09] <Se7en> How  do I tell
[05:41:16] <oranges> gcc -v
[05:41:26] <Se7en> Thought so
[05:41:29] <Se7en> wasn't sure
[05:41:30] <Se7en> gcc version 4.8.4 (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.3) 
[05:42:18] <oranges> and how did you install qtox?
[05:43:03] <oranges> i.e via package manager(and the package website) or via source
[05:45:19] <oranges> the 1.3.8 abi was introduced in gcc 4.9 and above
[05:45:53] <oranges> I know that antonbatev packaged qtox for ubuntu 14.04, so it might be worth asking zetok if he knows how that was achieved
[05:58:21] <Se7en> I got the binary from the github
[05:58:28] <Se7en> And put it in /usr/local/bin
[06:03:05] <Se7en> oranges, 
[06:03:36] <Se7en> My system is based on Ubuntu, ut it runs more like mainline debian
[06:05:52] <oranges> ah well that's the limit of my knowledge
[06:06:02] <oranges> I'm not up tto speed on qtox sorry
[06:06:07] <Se7en> I was using an older binary
[06:17:46] <Se7en> Also, did you  see this
[06:17:46] <Se7en> https://blog.tox.im/2016/04/01/litigation/
[07:48:32] *** Joins: abbat (~Anton@ )
[08:14:33] <zetok> Se7en: just use the repo
[08:18:30] <zetok> Se7en: https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Aantonbatenev%3Atox&package=qtox
[08:18:45] <Se7en> I can't use  the repo. It fails to work with Trisquel 7
[08:18:51] <Se7en> Why would you link me the OpenSUSE repo?
[08:19:04] <Se7en> Oh
[08:23:05] <Se7en> The repo doesn't work
[08:23:11] <Se7en> Because of version conflicts
[08:23:36] <zetok> are you sure that you're using the right repo?
[08:23:59] <Se7en>  qtox depends on libjpeg62-turbo (>= 1.3.1); however:
[08:23:59] <Se7en>   Package libjpeg62-turbo is not installed.
[08:23:59] <Se7en>  qtox depends on libmng1 (>= 1.0.10); however:
[08:23:59] <Se7en>   Package libmng1 is not installed.
[08:24:00] <Se7en>  qtox depends on libstdc++6 (>= 4.9); however:
[08:24:01] <Se7en>   Version of libstdc++6:amd64 on system is 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.3.
[08:24:02] <Se7en>  qtox depends on libxcb-keysyms1 (>= 0.4.0); however:
[08:24:04] <Se7en>   Version of libxcb-keysyms1:amd64 on system is 0.3.9-1ubuntu1.
[08:25:40] <Se7en> The Ubuntu one is really fucked
[08:25:45] <Se7en> But debian is less so
[08:27:14] <zetok> err
[08:27:25] <zetok> I'm almost sure that you're not using the right repo
[08:27:42] <Se7en> Trisquel will probably release thewir 8th release soon
[08:27:51] <Se7en> Maybe then the package manager won't be broken
[08:28:33] <zetok> given that libjpeg62-turbo is not even in *buntu 14.04..
[08:28:49] <abbat> Se7en, Trisquel 7.0 based on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Do you use Trusty repo?
[08:29:32] <Se7en> Yes I did
[08:29:57] <Se7en> I did that one, and it lists more dependency hell errors than the debian one
[08:33:21] <zetok> Se7en: `apt-cache show qtox` ?
[08:35:29] <Se7en> http://paste.lisp.org/display/318876/raw
[08:36:07] <Se7en> That's the ubuntu one
[08:42:57] <Se7en> zetok, oranges 
[08:43:08] <Se7en> I'll get you the debian one
[08:43:14] <Se7en> It must not have posted
[08:45:44] <Se7en> http://paste.lisp.org/+6U1R
[08:45:53] <Se7en> zetok, what should I do
[08:46:55] * zetok is not sure
[08:47:25] <zetok> abbat: um, *buntu package depends on stuff that is only available in debian..?
[08:47:48] <zetok> or rather, it's named differently in *buntu
[08:48:02] <abbat> zetok, No. libjpeg-turbo also in Trusty: http://packages.ubuntu.com/source/trusty/libjpeg-turbo
[08:48:37] <abbat> zetok, But http://paste.lisp.org/+6U1R - this is debian package
[08:49:59] <zetok> right
[08:50:09] <abbat> https://build.opensuse.org/package/binary/home:antonbatenev:tox/qtox?arch=x86_64&filename=qtox_201606210121%7E279225c_amd64.deb&repository=xUbuntu_14.04 - There is no depency from libjpeg-turbo
[08:50:15] <zetok> sorry, looked at wrong file
[08:51:32] <abbat> But seems we need static builds as static as we can for other distros.
[08:51:45] <zetok> Se7en: https://gist.github.com/zetok/da8e778e0bc1642b234cb47e4edcce38 ‚Üê *buntu 14.04 one, use the right repo
[08:52:38] <Se7en> Alright. I'll try it
[08:53:15] <zetok> abbat: um, do you think that PPA for 16.10 should be included in INSTALL.md ?
[08:54:11] <Se7en> The following packages have unmet dependencies:
[08:54:11] <Se7en>  qtox : Depends: libappindicator1 (>= 0.2.96) but it is not going to be installed
[08:54:12] <Se7en> E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).
[08:54:38] <Se7en> Wait. It did work that time
[08:54:46] <Se7en> It is fetching the dependencies
[08:57:35] <abbat> Se7en, http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/libs/libappindicator1 - exists in Trusty
[08:57:56] <Se7en> It works
[08:57:57] <Se7en> Except
[08:58:01] <Se7en> I logged into the thing.
[08:58:15] <Se7en> It is unable to access my chat logs, it said
