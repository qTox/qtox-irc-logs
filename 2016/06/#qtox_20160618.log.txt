[15:00:06] <sudden6> we could work around this by splitting the smileys.qrc by packs
[15:00:23] <zetok> I wonder about linking stage
[15:00:40] *** Quits: f10 (~flo@ ) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[15:00:51] <zetok> wouldn't the end result be the same?
[15:00:58] <zetok> if not, then why not
[15:01:06] <sudden6> maybe, idk
[15:01:35] <zetok> the downside of new hardware is that I even don't notice 10GB memleaks in qTox when testing :f
[15:01:46] <sudden6> on the other hand, 1,4G to compile doesn't sound to much for me
[15:01:59] <zetok> this is actually a lot
[15:02:28] <zetok> preferably qTox should compile just fine on 512MB
[15:02:37] <zetok> currently that's impossible, and not for good reasons
[15:02:42] <sudden6> I'm used to much more
[15:03:16] <sudden6> > not for good reasons -> yep, I strongly agree with this one
[15:07:41] *** Quits: abbat (~abbat@ ) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:07:42] <sudden6> <zetok> I wonder about linking stage -> shouldn't be a problem, since the object file is only a few MB actually
[15:07:54] <zetok> ok
[15:11:07] <sudden6> after some reading, splitting smileys.qrc doesn't sound that bad. We need the files compiled in anyways and splitting would decrease memory requirements during compilation

[16:42:44] <sudden6> "/usr/bin/time -v make"
[16:42:49] <sudden6> path is important
[16:43:50] <zetok> oh >.<
[16:43:55] <sudden6> about your locallib.conf grep stuff, why do we need to check if this line already exists?
[16:44:07] * zetok already had `time` in his `build.sh`, but without `-v`
[16:44:14] <sudden6> file is overwritten anyway?
[16:44:26] <zetok> err, right
[16:44:30] <sudden6> path "usr/bin" is also important
[16:44:40] <sudden6> because else it uses shell builtin
[16:44:40] * zetok goes to fix PR to not overwrite file, but to append
[16:44:53] <sudden6> your PR does already append
[16:44:59] <sudden6> mine doesn't

[16:51:23] <zetok> Diadlo: good idea
[16:51:46] <sudden6> not that much
[16:52:00] <zetok> oh, are warnings in C++ useless?
[16:52:12] * zetok is used to Rust where warnings are useful
[16:52:30] <sudden6> no, but they can be ignored/circumvented without fixing the real problem
[16:52:31] <Diadlo> I don't think, that it's useless
[16:52:58] <zetok> sudden6: D:
[16:54:15] <Diadlo> I don't think, that some g++ contributor says "Hmm.. We should add some useless warning for developers"
[16:55:04] <zetok> should I still make PR with split .qrc, even though it doesn't help much?
[16:55:28] <sudden6> zetok: yes, still makes sense to split them
[16:55:32] <zetok> ok
[16:57:13] <sudden6> zetok: your PR somehow broke the fedora build
[16:57:45] <zetok> sudden6: as expected

[16:59:41] <zetok> dunno :(
[17:01:25] <sudden6> me neither, on the initial setup of the new organization we said 2months, agilob and antis81 are near that, but both are pretty active on GH

[17:03:05] <zetok> nvm my idea
[17:03:41] <zetok> although since current system doesn't appear to work, switch to what nurupo talked about probably will need to happen
[17:04:02] <sudden6> what did nurupo talk about?
[17:04:23] <zetok> i.e. absent people have their vote counted as "refrained from vote" during the meeting
