[13:05:09] <zetok> and when it comes to changelog for app, it's broken, thus there's no point in using it
[13:07:02] <cisc> ahh nice, when you download 2 magnet links and have pending metadata coming in using qBittorrent, it partially locks up kwin for 60 seconds

[13:26:03] <cisc> qBittorent is likely the culprit, but kwin/plasmashell should be able to handle some naught code without crapping on itself
[13:26:26] <cisc> *y
[13:27:10] <cisc> how many lines of C++ is kwin anyway.. way I don't want to know
[13:29:47] <cisc> i think moving Connection Settings dialogue in qTox to the Advanced tab may be a better idea to clean up that lengthy General tab in settings, and possibly give Chat & Theme their own tab
[13:30:08] <cisc> or move them somewhere else, it's too long imo, all that scrolling

[22:36:26] <sudden6> zetok: can you ask tux3 and or antis81 about https://github.com/tux3/qTox/pull/3411 if you see them around?
[22:36:55] <zetok> yep
[22:38:25] <sudden6> thx, personally I think this is a good move, but I'd like to hear other opinions and counterarguments
[22:39:21] <zetok> antis81 most likely will comment on PR when he would have time
[22:40:27] <sudden6> yeah, maybe I'm a bit impatient^^
[22:40:42] <sudden6> but I hate to let others wait for a decision...
[22:41:13] * zetok knows the feel
[22:41:27] <zetok> and there's a trick to it
[22:41:33] *** Joins: hpanago (uid15586@ )
[22:41:39] <zetok> *test really well what you're merging*
[22:41:56] <zetok> and as long as no one complains, it's all good
[22:42:18] <zetok> sudden6: i.e. there's no point in waiting for answer that will not come
[22:42:41] <sudden6> I don't know how to apply this to the current situation
[22:43:22] <zetok> well, you should know what you're merging
[22:43:53] <zetok> provided that you know what the change results in, there's no problem
[22:44:02] <zetok> if you don't → educate yourself
[22:44:15] <zetok> (that's what I do with PRs to zetox)
[22:44:26] <sudden6> ahm, the mentioned PR doesn't really have something to test in the classical sense
[22:44:46] <zetok> mm :)
[22:44:58] <sudden6> and my short trip to the internet for education told me, it's good
[22:45:25] <sudden6> but I still feel like there should be counterarguments
[22:45:39] <sudden6> if there aren'T any it would be to good to be true
[22:46:56] <zetok> well, if I wasn't sure about something in Rust, I'd just read the Rust spec
[22:47:57] <zetok> how applicable is that to C++?
[22:48:33] <sudden6> rust spec is a lot more defined and leaves much less to the programmer IMHO
[22:48:37] <sudden6> so, not much
[22:48:46] <zetok> >_>
[22:49:07] <zetok> so even with hundreds of pages (thousands?) C++ spec is still useless?
[22:49:23] <sudden6> because of the hundreds of pages
[22:49:28] <sudden6> it's useless
[22:50:19] <zetok> that's just wrong
[22:51:25] <sudden6> at least it feels like that to me^^
[22:51:31] <zetok> mm
[22:52:13] <sudden6> Rust designers learned from the past mistake of letting developers do things the way they like
[22:53:35] <zetok> k
[22:53:53] * zetok will keep cultivating his C++ cargo cult
[22:54:13] <sudden6> what's a cargo cult?
[22:54:27] <zetok> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult
[22:54:39] <oranges> c++ was a mistake
[22:54:48] <oranges> it was like how can we take C and add everything
[22:56:00] <sudden6> yep
[22:56:19] <sudden6> still one of the most popular languages today
[22:56:43] <zetok> tux3 seems to like C++
[22:57:15] <zetok> hmm
[22:58:31] <zetok> at least qTox doesn't seem to get the kind of broken code that µTox gets
[22:59:14] <sudden6> zetok: I heard Encrypt is doing pkg.tox.chat now, does that mean we don't move to OBS entirely now?
[22:59:26] <zetok> ?
[22:59:32] <zetok> sudden6: I know nothing of this
[23:00:13] <sudden6> I mentioned OBS repo being better suited for users on #tox
[23:00:40] <sudden6> and that pkg.tox.chat would be discontinued sometime in the future
[23:01:36] <sudden6> then he answered, that he is maintaining package scripts for qtox on pkg.tox.chat
[23:01:57] <zetok> ok
[23:02:08] * zetok notes whom to blame for broken stuff
[23:02:15] <sudden6> I heard nothing of this either
[23:02:37] <sudden6> maybe we should invite him for a short discussion on #qtox?
[23:02:50] <zetok> I wonder if packages from tox.chat can still be trusted
[23:03:12] <sudden6> why?
[23:03:38] <zetok> trust is not something you have by default
[23:04:04] <sudden6> bad argument
[23:04:06] <zetok> so the question is "why would they be trusted?", rather than "why not trust?"
[23:04:16] <sudden6> why trust OBS then?
[23:04:52] <zetok> ~auditable + done by person who does a lot of good
[23:07:04] <sudden6> auditable also goes as far for pkg.tox.chat
[23:07:07] <zetok> bullshit
[23:07:47] <zetok> it can be easily made to look auditable while it's not at all auditable
[23:08:32] <sudden6> as can OBS
[23:09:04] <zetok> not really
[23:09:51] <sudden6> show me please
[23:10:48] <zetok> um?
[23:11:20] <sudden6> show me why OBS is auditable and pkg.tox.chat is not
