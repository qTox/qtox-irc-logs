[00:11:58] <tux3> No problem :)

[00:18:52] <Chiitoo> tux3: While you're here, I probably should ask for tips on where the margins for the left part of the area where we type things comes from, as well as the margins for the line between the header and footer/chatlog area.
[00:19:54] <tux3> Chiitoo, for the line, if I remember correctly it's horribly complicated and a combination of things, for the left part of the textarea, probably the main layout
[00:20:31] <Chiitoo> Heh.
[00:21:17] <Chiitoo> Yeah, I thought the main layout, too, but setting it to 0 didn't move it left at all, oddly, whily it does for the header.  As if something else is still there.
[00:21:40] <Chiitoo> It's all a bit weird to me still.
[00:22:11] <Chiitoo> Almost got them all figured out though!

[00:25:25] <Chiitoo> I thought for a moment that I fixed the bug that makes the layout all wrong, but it seems I didn't, after, all.  :|
[00:25:42] <Chiitoo> It seems it only triggeres when the layout is reloaded, so to speak.
[00:25:55] <Chiitoo> Triggers too.
[00:28:18] <tux3> Yeah, layouts can do weird things sometimes
[00:29:32] <Chiitoo> Especially if using the Qt Designer parts, heh.
[00:30:33] <Chiitoo> Not sure if it's just me, but the editor is really weird for me on that part.
[00:33:30] <tux3> Yeah, it works well for simple things, but after that it gets messy..
[00:37:46] <Chiitoo> So it seems.

[11:36:39] * zetok wonders whether to rewrite broken python script in Rust
[11:58:09] <zetok> tux3: dunno, script can't handle `.` in key value, do you think that you could do something about it?
[11:58:42] <tux3> zetok, I'm not a python expert, but I can look at it

[11:59:34] <zetok> there isn't one
[11:59:44] <zetok> the string is just missing in output files
[12:00:59] <tux3> Do you have an example of input / bad output?

[12:03:46] <tux3> I don't know where your bash script comes from, but when I run ./buildsite.py I don't see any problem
[12:04:07] <zetok> have you tried to run it after script?
[12:04:22] <tux3> Why would I do that?
[12:05:10] *** Quits: cisc (~cisc@ ) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[12:05:34] <zetok> eh
[12:05:48] <tux3> Your script makes no sense, running that would break everything

[12:06:26] <zetok> use dot in key
[12:06:33] <tux3> What key?
[12:06:42] <zetok> whichever one in json file
[12:06:56] <tux3> So like using sect1.description instead of sect1_description?
[12:07:04] *** Joins: cisc (~cisc@ )
[12:07:37] <zetok> eh, I'm trying to do what script does
[12:07:50] <tux3> The script you posted above makes no sense :/
[12:07:56] <zetok> it does though
[12:08:04] <zetok> https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/formats.html#json-files
[12:08:18] <tux3> build*.py doesn't contain sect1_description anywhere, why are you trying to replace sect1_description in buildsite.py?
[12:08:44] <tux3> And if you replace sect1_description with that huge sentence in the json files, you're just breaking all the files
[12:08:52] <zetok> was useful for `_language`, so I left it there
[12:09:46] <zetok> Yes.
[12:09:53] <tux3> Okay now I think I know what you're trying to do, but your script still makes no sense :)
[12:09:57] <zetok> what I'm trying to figure out is why it breaks
[12:10:08] <zetok> script works perfectly™
[12:10:25] <zetok> https://github.com/mustache/spec/blob/master/specs/interpolation.yml ← found why it breaks
[12:10:53] <tux3> If you're doing all of that for weblate, that's just so much work for so little ...
[12:11:26] <zetok> except that translations are important
[12:11:29] <tux3> Probably nobody will use Weblate to translate the website, except you :)
[12:11:48] * zetok shrugs
[12:12:05] * tux3 shrugs too
[12:12:06] <zetok> in process of making it translatable on weblate I'm also cleaning up & updating translation files
[12:12:17] <tux3> Well I'm not complaining :)
[12:12:34] <tux3> But that sounds like a lot of effort
[12:18:54] <zetok> >in version 0.5.2 onwards you are not allowed to have a plain tag/key name with a dot in it
[12:19:01] <zetok> ...
[12:32:38] <zetok> hmm.
[12:33:51] <zetok> the simplest option seems removing shitty pystache dependency and writing a ~custom replacement
[12:36:20] <tux3> Oh boy
[12:36:24] <tux3> >simplest
[12:36:55] <zetok> yeah, mustache is too broken to use, and pystache follows that insanity
[12:37:21] <zetok> the alternative is using pystache 0.5.1, that was released 4 years ago
[12:37:56] <zetok> and using 4 years old, not maintained python code is not really appealing
[12:38:37] <zetok> tux3: dunno, are you feeling up to the task? :D
[12:39:29] <tux3> zetok, haha hell no! But if you want to dive into the WebDev mustache insanity, go ahead! :)
[12:39:35] <zetok> what is needed is replacing tags enclosed in `{{{key}}}` from template file with value of `key` from json
[12:39:55] <zetok> well, not going into that insanity
[12:40:08] <zetok> I'll just write a bit of Rust code that will just work™
[12:40:08] <tux3> You can probably edit the buildsite.py to make it generate new json files tbh, but why even bother
[12:40:13] <tux3> Oh boy
[12:41:06] <zetok> you know, it could be a bit of simple replacement in python if you wanted – I simply don't know python :)
[12:42:05] <zetok> not sure why stq used pystache in the first place for simple replacement :s
[12:42:16] <tux3> stq knows python, you know rust :)
[12:42:29] <tux3> If you let me I'll write you a web server in ASM :)
[12:42:50] <tux3> With SSE4 and all.
[12:42:52] <zetok> err, no, it's not about the language, but about depending on shit you don't need
[12:43:06] <tux3> Python is about depending on shit you don't need
[12:43:15] <tux3> You just import the world, and you're done

[14:00:21] <linuxmodder> selinux using a  STIG setup
[14:00:46] <tux3> qTox tries to find its own path by looking into /proc/, then it looks in that directory for the portable settings
[14:01:20] <tux3> So I'll just use "./" instead on Linux, and if you change the current working directory, then it'll fail and it'll be your fault.
[14:01:25] <linuxmodder> tux3,  any  particular  dir  in there it wants?
[14:01:42] <linuxmodder> I can see about  making it  lax  OR a transitional bool
[14:01:51] <zetok> linuxmodder: every pid dir, I'd guess
[14:02:04] <tux3> linuxmodder, I imagine it checks /proc/self/cmdline

[14:04:02] <tux3> I'll just fall back to "./"
[14:04:43] <linuxmodder> assuming $user is  in wheel  you could use  sudo for the portable probe no?
[14:05:05] <linuxmodder> ubuntu and debian default to a wheel user as primary user
[14:05:36] <linuxmodder> and / or in /etc/sudoers.conf users could ADD a line for qtox specifically

[14:06:50] <tux3> Getting the current path is not a good reason..

[14:07:34] <tux3> Let's not even go down that path, I'm not elevating privileges just to get what is basically argv[0]
[14:07:34] <linuxmodder> ls  /proc  needs no root 
[14:08:51] <linuxmodder> so you are just gonna go back to  ~/.config/tox OR ./  for  settings dirs?
[14:09:06] <linuxmodder> as option 1 / 2 
[14:12:24] <tux3> I'll just check in ./, that works unless you mess with the current working directory

[14:33:51] <linuxmodder> genesis,  it can in some cases but  slow is fast, secure  in many cases (i.e. brute forcing| probes)
[14:34:15] <linuxmodder> and often times its neg. delays

[19:07:41] <zetok> ok
[19:07:46] <sudden6> nice
[19:13:01] <zetok> I was wondering about inviting people to qTox org
[19:13:22] <sudden6> who do you want to invite?
[19:13:56] <zetok> I had Rowen_Stripe and abbat on mind
[19:15:44] <zetok> possibly someone who'd want to maintain & develop website, no idea who would that be
[19:19:16] <sudden6> do you really think maintaining the website will require that much work?
[19:19:41] <sudden6> most of the relevant stuff really happens on gh
[19:19:55] <zetok> it will require someone who'd maintain it
[19:22:08] <sudden6> of course, but I think the expected workload could be handled by our core team in the near future
[19:22:17] <sudden6> so no need to rush anything
[19:22:35] <zetok> hmm
[19:22:57] <sudden6> if someone steps up and wants to do the website I of course wouldn't say no :)
[19:25:15] <sudden6> as for Rowen_Stripe and abbat I think it would honor their work
[19:25:42] <zetok> yeah :)
[19:27:14] <zetok> ok, made invitations
[19:29:04] * zetok wonders if there's anything else to discuss
[19:30:32] <zetok> oh, right
[19:31:27] <sudden6> I think there's https://github.com/tux3/qTox/pull/3351
[19:32:39] <zetok> on the packaging front, Gentoo users have it disabled
[19:33:10] <sudden6> I don't know if anybody manually compiles with filteraudio enabled
[19:33:22] <zetok> probably not
[19:33:54] <sudden6> mhm
[19:34:11] <linuxmodder> regarding the site  maintaining it will be  big issue if  its irrregularly checked
[19:36:11] <sudden6> linuxmodder: how do you mean?
[19:36:48] <linuxmodder> it can become a chore  fast to update shit
[19:38:50] <sudden6> I don't think the current website needs much maintaining, because it mostly links to github, which well maintained
[19:39:34] <linuxmodder> its hsoted where again atm ?
[19:39:43] <zetok> github
[19:40:50] <linuxmodder> github.io or  ghpages?
[19:41:10] <linuxmodder> .com or .io I mean
[19:41:20] <zetok> both
[19:43:41] <zetok> https://github.com/tux3/qTox/issues/3314
[19:43:59] <zetok> sudden6: do you still think that locking wouldn't be useful?
[19:45:01] <sudden6> pretty much yes
[19:45:25] <zetok> DaSpirit, tux3: ↑ ?
[19:46:07] <tux3> zetok, that sounds incredibly useless, use your screen locker or logout
[19:46:51] <zetok> tux3: screen locker when you're showing something to someone on your screen?
[19:47:30] <DaSpirit> If someone has access to your computer then having a locked screen wouldn't be the best way of stopping them from getting your stuff.
[19:48:05] <sudden6> DaSpirit: still better than just locking the application tough
[19:48:31] <zetok> tux3: also, logging-out is not an option, given that "log-in" is not instantaneous
[19:48:35] <DaSpirit> I agree with sudden6 on this matter.
[19:49:24] <linuxmodder> +1 to locking  hook
[19:50:18] <linuxmodder> and with a locked screen its harder (not impossible tho ) to mine pass / configs 
[19:50:54] <zetok> DaSpirit: it's not really about preventing someone from getting stuff, but more like providing a curtain that will hide private, possibly nsfw conversations when needed
[19:50:54] * linuxmodder uses two locks normally  a  gui locker and a full getty lock form tty
[19:51:24] <zetok> * not limited to conversations
[19:51:26] <linuxmodder> zetok,  so you invision it more as  a 'Panic button"
[19:51:43] <zetok> ~kinda
[19:51:46] * linuxmodder still reading issue thread
[19:53:28] <zetok> sudden6: um, mind providing a rationale?
[19:54:18] <zetok> sudden6: i.e. in the issue you've said that it's the job of screensaver/locker, but then Getron provided a good use case that screensaver/locker won't be able to handle
[19:55:06] <linuxmodder> another idea inactive or keybind  auto min to tray and forces login pass to remax
[19:56:38] <linuxmodder> similar to both Telegram and skype in omplementation 
[19:57:46] <linuxmodder> so `on-boarding` those user should be minimal efffort 
[20:00:24] <zetok> btw, a reflection from yesterday; "a moment ago I was looking at PR that doesn't zero out all the needed memory, and now I'm looking at this bullshit comment in issue claiming that ability to select area of shared desktop helps with security…"
[20:02:14] <zetok> upon reflecting further, one might realized that the latter is a real issue, while the former isn't – that's IMO quite good example of how programming makes one stop noticing real issues
[20:02:27] <zetok> realize*
[20:04:12] <zetok> So I'm just kinda wondering whether you've taken proper correction on your PoV ;)
[20:05:12] <sudden6> commented
[20:06:40] <sudden6> well security isn't privacy altough both are used interchangeably in everyday language
[20:07:32] <sudden6> the first part could be a security issue, but the second part is only a privacy issue
[20:07:48] <zetok> mm
[20:07:58] <zetok> but it's important enough to make one make an issue
[20:09:18] <zetok> >I understand your point clearly, but I'm very much against creating the false security provided by a password
[20:09:37] <zetok> I wonder about that
[20:10:33] <zetok> while creating false sense of security is obviously wrong, is it wrong to give users some functionality, but not pretend that given functionality isn't about security?

[20:12:15] <sudden6> how would you ensure users knowing it isn't secure?
[20:12:19] <zetok> also, while it may feel ~wrong, is it really wrong to provide for users functionality that they think will provide security, but not claiming that it will provide security?
[20:12:22] <zetok> you don't
[20:12:55] <zetok> if something may go wrong, it will go wrong

[21:30:50] <zetok> hm.
[21:30:51] <sysfu> If it's added for Ubuntu, it should work for most distros based on that I would imagine.
[21:31:01] <zetok> then it's os-specific
[21:31:13] <zetok> and supporting shit that *buntu does isn't really good

[21:45:55] <genesis> +election, people are not able to short their programm to essential and make strong party, we'll have perharps 15 candidates (but since we're not in democracy , it should be less)
[21:46:22] <zetok> genesis: um, do you have pirate party or its equivalent there?
[21:46:23] <genesis> generation ego :)
[21:46:23] <ovalseven8> abbat: Great repository!
[21:46:37] <genesis> yes but i'm opposite to their idea
[21:46:43] <zetok> oh?
[21:46:46] <genesis> and i dont like tech-washing
[21:46:54] <genesis> this is an mondialistic party
[21:47:16] <genesis> destroy nation, make internatiooooonaaal union , progress progress ...
[21:47:39] <zetok> in other words, optimize things
[21:47:49] <genesis> no history conscientiousness
[21:48:20] <genesis> same programm everywhere for everyone
[21:48:33] <genesis> since it's all know we're all the same for such people
[21:49:08] <zetok> I don't think that this is their goal
[21:50:05] <genesis> anyway i'm pro-sovereignty
[21:50:19] <zetok> rather, would other parties even try to tackle problems that are affecting everyone on global scale?

[21:51:32] <genesis> hum too difficult to speak about politic in english for me
[21:52:07] <genesis> global problem are made to force people to think we need unified politic to solve them
[21:52:17] <genesis> we have united nation to do that already
[21:52:44] <zetok> ><genesis> global problem are made to force people to think we need unified politic to solve them
[21:53:03] <zetok> I wonder about that.
[21:53:15] <genesis> globalism is opposite to democracy, concentrate power far from citizen
[21:53:53] <genesis> which problem , global warming ? 
[21:54:42] <zetok> that problem is being made by people not cooperating globally :)
[21:55:26] <genesis> i don't have job , no money, i don't care about that, i want frontier to protect my citizen from product made by underpaid childrens and people comes to bomb us
[21:55:51] <genesis> that's a clear point, if too much co2, don't care, plants grow faster and better.
[21:56:24] <genesis> (that's why we increase co2 by 3 in cultivation room)
[21:56:28] <zetok> heh, you might find that some plants are hard to grow underwater
[21:57:20] <genesis> true :) you've to eat algae
[21:58:38] <genesis> anyway, all global warming forum are pointless and already happens without shitty anti-democratic stuff as european union.
[21:59:39] <genesis> european union that allow roundup and GMO
[22:00:32] <zetok> roundup ?
[22:00:37] <genesis> glyphosate
[22:00:46] <genesis> famous herbicid by monsanto
[22:01:30] <genesis> new fashion of cultivation : kill all by herbicide roundup, then use resistant-gmo sells by same vendor
[22:02:37] <genesis> if you searsh a mass source of CO2, kill soil and let fermentation by anaerobic bacteria instead of soil decomposer worm and mushroom .
[22:03:00] <genesis> cultivation that took 12 calories for 1 calories of food
[22:03:21] <genesis> (oil calories)
[22:04:26] <genesis> enforce cooperation between states so people buy tomatoes that have make 2000km from portugal/maroc to france, france cereal to tunisia, ...
[22:04:51] <genesis> no frontier, GMO cereal from bresilia to france for farming
[22:07:05] <genesis> progress makes by capitalism will never make people happier.
[22:08:21] <zetok> mm
[22:08:54] <genesis> i'm specialist in soil and mycology, and hard ecologist 
[22:09:37] <genesis> the greatest thing in pirate party is that they want more democraty
[22:09:56] <genesis> do you know 90% of votation in the world are swiss votation ?
[22:10:06] <zetok> yeah
[22:10:13] <genesis> 90% for one little land
[22:10:19] <genesis> that's democraty
[22:10:47] <genesis> petition 100K people => institution helps you to write the text and there is votation
[22:11:14] <genesis> curiously, they never get into this EU thing ^^

[23:29:12] <zetok> fuck
[23:29:41] <zetok> tux3: I think that I found where problem is with qTox's sending duplicate messages
[23:29:58] <zetok> tux3: to reproduce you just need to repeatedly send messages
[23:30:06] <zetok> repeatedly, and quickly
[23:31:14] <zetok> i.e. qTox either doesn't save all sent message's ID, or doesn't send back all IDs of received messages, but only "latest" one
[23:31:50] <tux3> zetok, it's possible the read receipt code is fucked, last I checked it was during the database upgrade and it was a complete mess
[23:33:11] <zetok> no wonder that it's a qTox-only problem :F
[23:33:55] <zetok> https://a.uguu.se/FoYD82AQ3HZp.png -.-"
[23:38:23] <tux3> Ugh :/
