[20:16:05] <Sam____> Hello everyone
[20:17:33] <zetok> hi Sam____
[20:17:43] <Sam____> o/
[20:18:45] <Sam____> I'm a new user of qTox - just installed it today
[20:19:24] <Sam____> (I'm getting really fed up with all MS bullshit, if you see what I mean) ;)
[20:19:41] * zetok gets
[20:19:48] <Sam____> Everything works fine so far
[20:19:57] <zetok> that's great to hear :)
[20:20:50] <Sam____> But I would like to make some proposals somewhere. Because yeah, the next step for me is to convince people around to use qTox
[20:21:27] <zetok> mm
[20:22:13] <Sam____> And there's like 2-3 things that could help people installing it and using it. It's only a proposal, of course. I put the subject on the table, and if some people doesn't disagree with me, maybe there are (good)things to do
[20:23:06] <Sam____> I've seen some "issues topics" on github, but I don't know if this is where I should do those proposals... ? :3
[20:23:35] <zetok> probably
[20:23:58] <zetok> i.e. if it's about qTox itself, then yes
[20:24:09] <zetok> if it's about tox.chat repo, then no
[20:24:11] <Sam____> It's about qTox itself
[20:25:00] <Sam____> As I have a bunch of ideas, should I open 1 issue topic per idea, or can I put all the ideas in only 1 topic (like a general feedback) ?
[20:25:32] <zetok> note that you might want to do a quick search to see if someone could have proposed something like your ideas already :)
[20:25:38] <zetok> that depends
[20:25:45] <Sam____> Yep, I started to do that ;)
[20:25:56] <zetok> generally, you'd want to put things in separate issues
[20:26:14] <Sam____> That's okay
[20:26:24] <zetok> though sometimes when functionality depends on other things you might want to group it
[20:27:15] <Sam____> Hum... yeah, I see what you mean... To tell the truth, I don't even know if what I want to propose is technically possible, so...
[20:27:27] <Sam____> Well, I'm gonna give a try. Thank you for the advices
[20:27:33] <zetok> you're welcome :)
[20:27:48] <Sam____> And thank you for your contributions, as I've seen you are a lot engaged into this project ;)
[20:28:54] <Sam____> Oh, by the way... If it is about not the software, but about qTox website? Where should I put the suggestions? 
[20:29:12] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox-Website
[20:29:34] <Sam____> Yup, but I meant... improvements about the website ;)
[20:29:40] <zetok> issues there :)
[20:30:16] <Sam____> Oh, right, my bad. I'm not quite familiar with Github, even if it's not the first project I see there...
[20:32:48] <zetok> lucky day, eh :P https://xkcd.com/1053/
[20:42:49] <Sam____> X)
[20:43:05] <Sam____> Oh, last question
[20:44:47] <Sam____> is there a special target for the use of qTox? I mean, is is meant to be used by anyone, or is it meant to be used only by people who have an "opensource software" mind?
[20:46:16] <Sam____> (like Linux comunity, etc.)
[20:46:29] <zetok> "Security & Ease of Use"
[20:47:01] <Sam____> Ease of use, okay, it includes anybody who owns a computer
[20:47:06] <Sam____> It's perfect
[21:02:04] <Sam____> 1st friend I convince to install the software. I'm writing down all she says to me (the things that should be improved)... 
[21:02:05] <Sam____> ^^
[21:02:30] <zetok> mm :)
