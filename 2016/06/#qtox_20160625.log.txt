[16:47:32] <Saamm> Who wrote the code for the website? :3
[16:48:03] <zetok> look at contributors on gh :)
[16:48:31] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox-Website/graphs/contributors
[16:49:15] <zetok> hm, that just shows top 100 :f
[16:49:56] <Saamm> X)
[16:49:59] <Saamm> Thank you
[16:52:05] <Saamm> There are some subtle changes compared to a "normal" website... like the [[[ ]]] for each link, I guess it may be some syntax needed for GitHub, but I can't be sure about that. So it makes me wondering about all those syntax differences...
[16:52:36] <zetok> er
[16:52:55] <zetok> text inside `[[[ ]]]` is being changed by sterminator
[16:52:59] <Saamm> Hum, it's not even about the links, it's for each "block" of text...
[16:53:27] <zetok> https://github.com/zetok/sterminator
[16:53:29] <Saamm> sterminator? oO
[16:53:39] <Saamm> Thanks, I'll look at this now
[16:53:53] <Saamm> Ohh, I see
[16:55:08] <Saamm> That's a cool thing, Sterminator, I didn't know about that :p
[17:05:37] <Saamm> Got to go, have a nice day guys
