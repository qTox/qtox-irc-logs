[00:48:04] <cisc> on this PR: https://github.com/tux3/qTox/pull/3311 my USB Mic's gain has just about no input volume when the slider is moved from 0-60%, and from 75-100% is where it starts to register

[03:44:23] <zero-ghost> just tried a group call after a while of not using it

[03:44:57] <zero-ghost> when a 3rd person calls the group its just choppy and unuseable

[04:56:35] <zero-ghost> damn right
[04:56:38] <zero-ghost> they de-prove
[04:56:47] <zero-ghost> cause group calls worked great at one point
[05:38:37] <zetok> cisc: could you make an issue for it?
[05:40:53] <cisc> zetok: yeah but I first want to see if it's my mic or not
[05:41:10] <zetok> yes and no
[05:41:11] <cisc> and if anybody else experienced similar behaviour
[05:41:47] <zetok> i.e. PR did change behaviour, and if it's a change for worse (like it seems to be) it should be reported
[05:42:21] <zetok> as for mic – yep, it's partially due to your mic, but then again, qTox should be able to handle it correctly
[05:42:32] <cisc> for me with my USB mic with that PR, the slider from 0-100 should be what 75-100 currently does, if that makes sense
[05:43:09] <zetok> yep, would be good if you put all that info in the issue :)

[17:22:58] <ovalseven8> tux3: Very cool! https://github.com/tux3/qTox/pull/3353
[17:23:24] <tux3> ovalseven8, thanks! It's a work in progress :)
[17:28:29] <aLugarius> what is EXACTLY meand by multidevice? Accounts?
[17:28:40] <zetok> ..
[17:30:40] <tux3> Multiples Tox profiles that are synchronised together.
[17:30:54] <tux3> So they look like a single profile
[17:31:49] <zetok> compatibility?
[17:32:33] <tux3> It breaks the API, but I don't think it breaks the protocol
[17:32:54] <zetok> well, API breakage is expected
[17:33:15] <zetok> aside from protocol, I was wondering about save format
[17:33:27] <tux3> No breakage here unless I fucked up
[17:33:52] <zetok> i.e. it would be *bad* if someone upgraded, and then they used older toxcore with the save, resulting in erased data
[17:34:41] <tux3> That would be a disaster, and it will not happen because I'll review & test things carefully before actually using them
[17:35:01] <zetok> sounds almost too good to be true
[17:35:06] <tux3> Right now I'm 95% sure the save code is correct, but I haven't reviewed it carefully, so there could be a surprise
[17:35:18] * zetok has already started mentally preparing for data loss during testing
[17:36:29] <tux3> During testing, sure. If you run my toxcore straight from trunk expect the worst :)
[17:36:49] <zetok> I'll start testing when you'll say that it's ready ;)
[17:37:17] <tux3> It's not that bad :) Since the save is separated into sections, the worst that can reasonnably happen is your device list being blanked 
[17:37:46] <tux3> But yeah, better wait until it's ready!
[17:40:41] <zetok> tux3: what do you think about download mirrors?
[17:42:32] <tux3> zetok, I don't pay for the bandwith, why should I start worrying about mirrors :) ?
[17:42:43] <linuxmodder-> zetok,  for ?
[17:42:46] <linuxmodder-> the binaries or everythng
[17:43:40] <zetok> tux3: a bit of redundancy
[17:44:10] <zetok> I'm wondering though whether effort would be worth it
[17:44:17] <tux3> zetok, sounds like gratuitous complexity, we're not a power plant :)
[17:44:33] <tux3> If we have 5 minutes of downtime a year we'll survive
[17:45:25] <linuxmodder-> zetok,  on that note how do you plan to ensure security of mirror hosts?

[22:48:05] <nurupo> zetok: were you invited to the meeting ovalseven8 made yesterday?
[22:48:25] <zetok> nope
[22:48:46] <nurupo> he brought up the issue that tox doesn't have a pr person
[22:49:47] <nurupo> the meeting ended with grayhatter nominating himself to post things on our blog/twitter and tux3, LittleVulpix, ovalseven8, stal, Jfreegman and others agreeing
[22:50:21] <zetok> lol
[22:51:00] <nurupo> so you see, we now have better organization :)
[22:51:29] <zetok> yes, I see that you're keen on making things worse
[22:51:47] <nurupo> i was keeping saying that we also need a website person, but unfortunately no one was willing to help with that :\
[22:53:59] * zetok wonders
[22:54:25] <zetok> nurupo: are you really no able to see that grayhatter is the worst person for that position?
[22:54:35] <zetok> s/no /not /
[22:55:38] <nurupo> he doesn't have direct access to publish things, whatever he writes has to go through a review before it gets published
[22:56:15] <zetok> that doesn't change anything
[22:56:44] <zetok> i.e. what does that have to do with grayhatter being the worst kind of person for the position?
[22:57:18] <nurupo> oh well, you probably know grayhatter better than we all do
[22:57:37] <zetok> as if that was needed
[22:57:41] <nurupo> ask ovalseven8 to invite you to the next meeting
[22:57:50] <nurupo> there is also #tox-meeting for that
[22:57:53] <zetok> I don't see the point
[22:58:18] <zetok> i.e. people are free to waste their time and in process of doing so make tox.chat worse

[22:59:44] *** Quits: sudden6 (~anonymous@ ) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[22:59:59] <zetok> nurupo: also, you sound like "knowing" someone would suddenly make your judgement superior
[23:00:56] <zetok> right, that's probably not really clear
[23:01:24] <zetok> nurupo: you might find it interesting that "knowing" someone does cloud one's judgement of the person in question
[23:03:05] <LittleVulpix> zetok: I'm actually curious, what's your beef with grayhatter?
[23:03:43] <zetok> circumstances
[23:04:11] <LittleVulpix> Elaborate?
[23:04:31] <zetok> i.e. I wouldn't care about grayhatter if not for the position that he insists on being in, and other supporting crap he does there
[23:05:28] <LittleVulpix> Why do you hate him? Legit question
[23:05:39] <zetok> :3
[23:05:43] <zetok> aw, no
[23:06:01] <zetok> I wouldn't waste something so precious as my hate on grayhatter
[23:06:16] <LittleVulpix> Okay, let me rephrase... what is it that he does that irks you so much?
[23:06:36] <zetok> being limited in his position
[23:06:46] <LittleVulpix> I don't follow
[23:06:47] <zetok> actually
[23:07:15] <zetok> being limited is normal, what is the problem is his outright refusal to even think of possibility of not being limited
[23:07:53] <LittleVulpix> Too metaphysical for me. Can you be more concrete? :o
[23:09:08] <zetok> and what would that be?
[23:09:30] <LittleVulpix> What makes grayhatter the worst person for PR possible?
[23:09:49] <zetok> oh, right, I thought that it was clear
[23:10:03] <zetok> his refusal to think
[23:10:46] <LittleVulpix> He seems to think a lot, after all he's writing stuff for toxcore (his own branch, granted, but he's doing it). He also writes stuff for uTox
[23:10:56] <zetok> so?
[23:11:05] <LittleVulpix> So he clearly doesn't refuse to think
[23:11:12] <zetok> bullshit
[23:11:42] <zetok> just because person thinks about a) doesn't mean that they don't refuse thinking about b)
[23:12:01] <LittleVulpix> So... his refusal to think about <things that a PR person should think about> ?
[23:12:44] <zetok> yes and no
[23:13:24] <zetok> I've just noticed a general trend for grayhatter to refuse to think about himself
[23:14:06] <zetok> the problem with that is that if there is a problem with person, if they refuse to think about themselves, there's no way to "fix" the problem
[23:14:27] <LittleVulpix> Hmm... I assume you mean something other than "being selfless" ? I don't know grayhatter much. But I helped him debug some stuff for uTox on winXP a while back, and I know he writes a lot for toxcore... and he is maintaining uTox
[23:14:36] <LittleVulpix> He was at the meeting and he was one of the 3 people that actually bothered to speak
[23:15:00] <zetok> again: so?
[23:15:02] <LittleVulpix> And he volunteered for the PR position as no-one else did, even knowing he'd have to have his posts reviewed
[23:15:30] <LittleVulpix> So my point is... I see nothing wrong with him. Clearly you've been involved with him in a situation where something happened that he did that you strongly disagreed with
[23:15:39] <LittleVulpix> And you have not gotten over it (perhaps it was that bad?)
[23:15:54] <LittleVulpix> But I don't know what that was, and you aren't being helpful
[23:16:10] <LittleVulpix> So I have no reason to think grayhatter is any less good than anyone else here
[23:16:12] <zetok> :D
[23:16:26] <zetok> I'm just pointing out at the root of the problem, not the symptoms
[23:16:59] <zetok> if you want symptoms, look at the logs
[23:17:11] <LittleVulpix> Maybe I'm just slow, but I haven't figured out what you're pointing at. All you're saying is that he doesn't see himself as the problem where you believe him to be.
[23:17:14] <LittleVulpix> See that's what I mean
[23:17:15] <LittleVulpix> I wasn't here
[23:17:18] <LittleVulpix> I haven't seen the logs
[23:17:55] <LittleVulpix> And from what I've seen and from how I've interfaced with grayhatter (and the rest of you); he may be a bit hot-headed but he means well, and he's in touch with gentoo about stuff + he's trying to be helpful in chat / on github.
[23:18:25] <zetok> >he may be a bit hot-headed but he means well
[23:18:29] <zetok> you've missed the poin
[23:18:32] <zetok> point*
[23:18:59] <zetok> >All you're saying is that he doesn't see himself as the problem where you believe him to be.
[23:19:16] <zetok> I'm saying that given how he is, he's problematic in position he's in
[23:19:38] <LittleVulpix> Hmm. Give him/it time. Maybe you'll be surprised?
[23:19:49] <zetok> I did :3
[23:19:57] <LittleVulpix> I feel like we're talking about two different people
[23:20:07] <zetok> and no, I wasn't surprised, he didn't improve, exactly as I was expecting
[23:20:13] <LittleVulpix> because the hotheadedness etc - it's only what I heard from others
[23:20:16] <LittleVulpix> I've never "seen" it
[23:20:58] <LittleVulpix> zetok you should definitely come to the next meeting, maybe sort it out with grayhatter ? I mean you're both adults no
[23:21:12] <zetok> LittleVulpix: you've missed the point :)
[23:21:21] <LittleVulpix> No I didn't, you've missed the meeting
[23:22:10] <zetok> err, from what I understand, I didn't waste my time
[23:22:37] <LittleVulpix> Yeah but you see how if everyone said that, nothing would ever happen...
[23:23:18] <LittleVulpix> Really just if there is a next one, or if you dislike how grayhatter does things, just... I dunno. Talk to him. I mean, talk to him _again_ ... without maybe being so condescending and such
[23:23:25] <LittleVulpix> Maybe I dunno, really
[23:23:32] <zetok> LittleVulpix: and the point was that I don't have particular business with grayhatter – you might want to note that he's in the position only because of other people being fine with it
[23:23:51] <cisc> zetok send him a flower bouquet
[23:24:06] <zetok> cisc: c-can I send cat pics instead?
[23:24:11] <LittleVulpix> zetok: we'll see how it goes. So far the world's not on fire yet :p
[23:24:37] <zetok> pls.
[23:24:44] <LittleVulpix> I'm serious
[23:25:24] <LittleVulpix> Give it / him a chance. AGAIN, if that's required :p if he blows it then we'll just not post his stuff and he won't get to be the PR person
[23:25:28] <zetok> If that wasn't a joke, I'd say that your standards are pretty off, to the point where you'd let something to die in order to acknowledge that something isn't right.
[23:25:43] <cisc> grayhatter=it now? lol
[23:25:46] <LittleVulpix> The world thing? It was a joke
[23:25:56] <LittleVulpix> :p no, grayhatter=him, it=pr position
[23:26:44] <zetok> LittleVulpix: um, I'm not speaking only about PR
[23:27:13] <zetok> and regarding chances – he had plenty given
[23:27:18] <LittleVulpix> zetok: but I was... wasn't that your whole problem? Nah it's too late for me to be delving deeper into this, I need sleep :p but really just go talk to him right now
[23:27:43] <LittleVulpix> Tell him how you feel about what's going on and ask him what his plan is, maybe
[23:27:48] <zetok> LittleVulpix: you're forgetting about the point where he refuses to think
[23:28:11] <LittleVulpix> x3 I dunno but it's you stuck in a while loop right now, not him.
[23:28:17] <zetok> LittleVulpix: talking with someone who refuses to think about the conversation topic is a waste of time
[23:28:26] <LittleVulpix> Make him think then
[23:28:32] <LittleVulpix> waste a bit of your time if necessary
[23:28:33] <zetok> waste of my time
[23:28:36] <LittleVulpix> do it
[23:28:39] <zetok> I'm not here to make people think
[23:28:47] <zetok> that's their own job to do
[23:29:08] <zetok> also, refusing to think is a natural defence mechanism
[23:29:16] <LittleVulpix> :p I dunno... well anyway
[23:29:52] <zetok> I don't feel good about breaking people :/
[23:30:10] <LittleVulpix> I mean no harm. I just don't understand. I get your point but I have no evidence to support it, cause I don't know grayhatter well enough; but I also don't know you well enough to just believe what you say without seeing it myself. I mean
[23:30:11] <LittleVulpix> You know.
[23:30:14] <LittleVulpix> The internet and all
[23:30:42] <zetok> sure ;)
[23:30:45] <LittleVulpix> :)
[23:30:53] <zetok> that's why I said to read the logs if you want symptoms :)
[23:31:42] <zetok> LittleVulpix: anyway, as you said, you probably should go to sleep :)
[23:31:51] <zetok> sleep well ;D
[23:32:17] <LittleVulpix> zetok: I was up 27 hours fixing a big bad broken system; up until 3hrs ago
[23:32:20] <LittleVulpix> ~2 hrs actually
[23:32:22] <LittleVulpix> So yes
[23:32:33] <LittleVulpix> nite

[23:43:30] <cisc> I can't find a decent app in F-Droid for encrypted messaging that doesn't rely on SMS
[23:43:48] <cisc> and there's Signal but that deps on Google Play
[23:46:45] <zetok> just use Antox
[23:46:49] <zetok> ;D
[23:47:13] <cisc> but how is that going to work with offline messaging
[23:47:40] <zetok> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[23:48:09] <cisc> is the antox repo getting any commits is the question
[23:48:21] <cisc> I haven't seen any activity on IRC From the new dev in months
[23:48:27] <zetok> valid question
[23:48:37] <zetok> I'm afraid that I don't know the answer though
[23:48:51] <cisc> ever since sublin dumped it
[23:48:56] <zetok> >tfw my Antox didn't receive a single update since months
[23:49:03] <zetok> sounds about right
[23:49:15] *** Quits: dardevelin (~dardeveli@ ) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[23:49:18] <zetok> :(
[23:49:37] <cisc> well that is why I was looking for an alternate, you could say "when antox is ready" but it doesn't look like it may ever be ready
[23:49:53] <cisc> when 3 devs dumped it in a row
[23:50:03] <zetok> >.<
[23:51:36] <cisc> ok found it https://github.com/Antox/Antox/commits/master
[23:51:39] <zetok> (!)
[23:51:58] <zetok> I remember hearing about an encrypted IM for android
[23:52:11] <cisc> okay so it is getting commits, I guess he's just not on IRC Much
[23:52:39] <zetok> kontalk is its name
[23:52:45] <cisc> yeah I saw that..
[23:53:03] <cisc> but I dont think its available for iPhone, so that is limiting for people that you know that only use ithings
[23:54:14] <zetok> um
[23:54:28] <zetok> iphone users can just use some other xmpp supporting app
[23:54:41] <zetok> its not like they can expect security using iphone anyway
[23:55:09] <zetok> eh.
[23:55:18] <zetok> well, night
[23:55:20] <cisc> better than SMS, clear text
[23:55:21] <cisc> night
