[10:28:41] <sudden6> since qt is creating an array for every file and theres ~2000 of them only in emojione, I think it's the sheer number of arrays that causes the huge memory usage

[12:02:47] <linuxmodder> sudden6,  what compression algo used 
[12:02:58] <sudden6> I think qt uses zlib

[12:05:54] <linuxmodder> yep
[12:06:34] <sudden6> I pushed a fix for simple_make.sh would be cool if you could also test it :)
[12:06:38] <linuxmodder> btw is the author of PR/3402  in the room ?
[12:06:56] <linuxmodder> sudden6, was that yours  ? 3402 
[12:07:04] <sudden6> yes

[12:09:13] <linuxmodder> sudden6,  for {dnf_install}   in that pull (3402) I'd recommend  making it  @development-tools @rpm-development-tools  (c-development is not needed here --unless I missed a recent addition needing it) 
[12:10:10] <linuxmodder> also for rpmfusion its safer to use  https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora=rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm rather than the current $fedora_release)

[12:13:19] <sudden6> AFAIR c-development-tools was needed because of libtool

[12:37:57] <zetok> yes, and you could help to make that happen :)
[12:39:22] <w7AeVytY> well, use an version of debian that has nothing, (no file manager, no browser, so almost no Library) and run the scripst that creates an appimage from deb repo
[12:39:32] <w7AeVytY> done
[12:40:19] <w7AeVytY> ubuntu should work too
[12:41:14] <linuxmodder> zetok,  sudden6  if I was to merge in 3402 and re running PR with mods  git checkout  3402  would work ?

[12:42:15] <w7AeVytY> export APP=qtox && ./apt-appdir/apt-appdir $APP && ./AppImageAssistant.AppDir/package $APP.AppDir $APP.AppImage && ./$APP.AppImage

[12:43:09] * sudden6 doubts
[12:45:07] <zetok> w7AeVytY: from what I understand that would be limited to debian/*buntu â€“ isn't the whole point of AppImage to make things distro-independent?
[12:45:16] <sudden6> linuxmodder: just get newest git master, modify the file, "git checkout -b fedora_packages" and push to your qtox repo
[12:45:25] <sudden6> then make a PR via webinterface
[12:45:55] <linuxmodder> so -b fedora_packages already  exists ?
[12:45:58] <linuxmodder> nice okay
[12:46:11] <sudden6> no you creat it locally, 
[12:46:28] <sudden6> (with the command I posted)
[12:46:42] <w7AeVytY> then it should be distro independent, just deinstall all libs that qtox needs and create the app image, or using an croped debian, then it should work on arch fedora and co too
[12:46:58] <sudden6> also after "git checkout..." you have to make your commit as usual
[12:47:12] <zetok> >deinstall all libs that qtox needs and create the app image
[12:47:14] <zetok> yeah, no
[12:47:30] <sudden6> there goes "just run a script"
[12:47:56] <w7AeVytY> or chroot in an other system
[12:48:14] <zetok> w7AeVytY: spending so much time for so little doesn't seem worth it
[12:48:54] <zetok> out of 3 new package formats appimage looks most promising though
