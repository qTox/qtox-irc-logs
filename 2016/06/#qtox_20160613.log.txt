[14:05:45] <sudd3n6> seems ok
[14:06:07] <sudd3n6> tough I wonder why qTox gets so many false positives
[14:06:15] *** sudd3n6 is now known as sudden6
[14:08:00] <zetok> p2p, clickbaiting people to report issues on gh, uses encryption & verifies that updates are actually signed – all the reasons to rise red flag
[14:09:16] <zetok> + it uses a few dirty tricks that play with windows' permission stuff to install & update – antiviruses don't like that
