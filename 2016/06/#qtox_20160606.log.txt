[08:44:08] <zetok> err, AFAIK that's limited to tox.chat people
[08:45:06] <nurupo> also grayhatter
[08:45:16] <nurupo> i asked him to write a blog post about qtox website
[08:45:27] <nurupo> he replied with a huge pile of profanity

[08:47:00] <nurupo> on the other hand, they like and respect tux3, so just use tux3 as a proxy to ask for things
[08:48:02] <zetok> lol
[08:48:25] <zetok> I told you that grayhatter is the worst person for PR
[08:51:46] <zetok> LittleVulpix: ↑ there you go, you might want to ask grayhatter to fix his shitty attitude – as I said yesterday though, you'll fail, given reasons :)

[15:53:41] <SkyzohKey> zetok: Would you like to use some cool changelog generator for qTox ?
[15:53:43] <SkyzohKey> + hi :p
[15:53:50] <SkyzohKey> Results in: https://github.com/RicinApp/Ricin/blob/master/docs/CHANGELOG.md
[15:54:00] <SkyzohKey> And here is the tool: https://github.com/skywinder/github-changelog-generator
[15:55:00] <zetok> > ruby
[15:55:07] * zetok throws it into the trash
[15:55:18] <SkyzohKey> don't care about ruby lel
[15:55:26] <SkyzohKey> that's a tool like another one
[15:55:42] <SkyzohKey> and it does the job pretty well
[15:55:42] <zetok> you might want to note that qTox already has support for changelog generateor
[15:55:45] <zetok> generator*
[15:55:49] <SkyzohKey> yes, it uses clog
[15:55:54] <SkyzohKey> Ricin also was using clog
[15:56:04] <SkyzohKey> but this generator is far more powerful ^^
[16:03:06] <zetok> I don't see that much of benefit
[16:03:15] <zetok> on the other side, I see quite a few downside
[16:03:20] <zetok> downsides*

[21:37:32] <linuxmodder> zetok,  he is better than you 
[21:37:38] <linuxmodder> you are toxic 
[21:38:43] <linuxmodder> zetok,  downsides?  please do elaborate
[21:41:34] <zetok> formatting & depending on github
[21:44:45] <zetok> linuxmodder: mind elaborating on toxicity?
[21:54:03] *** Quits: ovalseven8 (~ovalseven@ ) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[21:54:16] <linuxmodder> sure if you also elaborate on your last one 
[21:55:13] <zetok> which part of depending on a proprietary, closed service that one day will be gone is not bad?
[21:55:15] <linuxmodder> toxicity is the fact even other devs consider you a  shitbag and  you are hostile to damn near everyone that wants to help non dev minded folks that wish to help or  wish to comment / document things for those in part one of my statement
[21:55:44] <zetok> Right.
[21:55:44] <linuxmodder> zetok,  then use pagure / obs or gitlab  fucker the port over would be rather trivial overall
[21:59:00] <zetok> linuxmodder: AFAIK only tox.chat people consider me to be hostile – as for their exact opinion on me, I have only your words
[21:59:22] <zetok> as for people who would want to help – mind giving example of me being hostile?
[22:01:36] <zetok> linuxmodder: you might want to ponder on how in similar situation grayhatter would have you banned already :)
[22:20:31] <zetok> Hm.
[22:23:37] <zetok> Makes one wonder though, whether accusations of hostility didn't arise from simple lack of knowledge how real hostility would look like.
[22:29:36] <linuxmodder> zetok,  grayhatter woul dhave banned me for what?
[22:30:50] <zetok> linuxmodder: you don't remember?
[22:31:04] <linuxmodder> apparently not
[22:31:31] <zetok> well, grep your logs
[22:32:24] <linuxmodder> for ?
[22:32:45] <zetok> yourself being banned :)
[22:33:18] <linuxmodder> he was in a shitty mood that day and so was I you are chronicly  shitty mood
[22:34:42] <zetok> >you are chronicly  shitty mood
[22:35:22] <zetok> you know, if that sentence was about grayhatter it would fit perfectly
[22:35:49] <zetok> sadly(?), I don't fit there :3
[22:36:48] <zetok> "if you don't have what you like, like what you have"
[22:37:45] * zetok pulls out bat clue
[22:37:52] <zetok> go figure, linuxmodder ;)
[22:37:59] <linuxmodder> zetok,  being  totally frank you seem to be trying to derail qtox into your own baby and I personally  think its deplorable
[22:38:33] <zetok> linuxmodder: I'm trying to help qTox become something that everyone can use to communicate securely
[22:39:18] <linuxmodder> ever since you joined qtox it seems all you care about it ubuntu and  also seem to not give two fucks about anyone that is non-dev type or trying to help lower the jargon bar for non-dev types
[22:39:23] <zetok> linuxmodder: if you (or someone else) know how to do that better than me, please do so
[22:41:35] <zetok> lol
[22:41:41] <linuxmodder> zetok,  I have little time but seems you are more abbrassive then helpful for most 
[22:43:14] <zetok> linuxmodder: if by "helpful" you mean "get fucked over by tox.chat" then yes, I'm not interested in that
[22:43:25] <oranges> absolute madman
[22:43:38] <linuxmodder> zetok,  tox.caht people being ?
[22:43:44] <linuxmodder> oranges,  who?
[22:43:51] <zetok> everyone ^^
[22:44:07] <linuxmodder> zetok,  so its world against zetok then?
[22:44:12] <linuxmodder> is that how you see it 
[22:44:16] <zetok> eh.
[22:44:33] <zetok> no.
[22:45:04] <linuxmodder> that's how it came across 
[22:45:15] <zetok> right, I shouldn't try to joke
[22:45:17] <zetok> my bad
[22:45:21] <linuxmodder> oranges,  who are you calling an absolute madamn
[22:45:41] <linuxmodder> jokes are fine but yours seem to be  dull 
[22:45:50] <zetok> might be
[22:46:07] <linuxmodder> i used to be dull in the joke dept too that can be  fixed :)
[22:46:11] <oranges> you, zetok, me, irungentoo
[22:46:12] <oranges> the feds
[22:46:31] <zetok> everyone ^^
[22:47:21] <zetok> aw, I have a good song for that, but it's not in English :c
[22:48:17] <linuxmodder> zetok,  language is merely a construct

[22:51:15] <zetok> linuxmodder: as for your question regarding tox.chat – shouldn't you know that better?
[22:52:39] <zetok> I don't care about tox.chat, so I don't really follow what they do
[22:52:56] <zetok> and of whom it's currently composed of
[22:53:41] <zetok> I care about the crap they do that negatively affects qTox, and their refusal to take responsibility for it

[22:58:18] <zetok> Hm.
