[11:57:40] <sudden6> PafXUS: I don't think there's a specific reason, besides it is the easiest way to code
[11:58:15] <sudden6> also I thought nearly all Qt types are passed by reference by default?
[12:00:59] * zetok wonders about emoticons
[12:01:33] <PafXUS> what you mean "Qt types are passed by reference by ->Default<-"? 
[12:03:41] <sudden6> I may be very wrong here, but I thought if I write something like `print(QString abc);` the data of QString isn't copied for the function
[12:04:04] <sudden6> zetok: what exactly
[12:04:05] <PafXUS> if you talking about method signatures in Qt types - yes they are wrote that way, so they accept constant references to types they want to use or copy inside, but in qTox codebase - there are alot of places where objects passed by value inside methods
[12:05:01] <sudden6> can you link to a specific case?
[12:05:41] <zetok> sudden6: about "better" being an enemy of "good enough" reciprocally
[12:05:46] <zetok> i.e. the PR
[12:06:49] <zetok> sudden6: i.e. it's "good enough" to merge, but "better" would be with all stuff "included" and picker "fixed"
[12:07:33] <zetok> then again, "good enough" works for most people, so chances of picker being fixed if no one really sees a problem are a bit low
[12:08:00] <zetok> I mean, /eventually/ it would be fixed
[12:08:02] <zetok> :s
[12:08:22] <sudden6> now you're talking bussiness ;) of course it would be better, but I think also a small step is a sucess
[12:09:04] <zetok> well, good enough for merge ;)
[12:09:49] <zetok> sudden6: oh wait
[12:10:31] <zetok> actually, nvm
[12:11:32] <PafXUS> examples are: rawdatabase.h Query constructor, Text.h Constructor (QString by ref, but QFont by value), filetransferwidget.cpp fileTransferRemotePausedUnpaused(ToxFile)

[12:13:18] <zetok> um
[12:13:47] <sudden6> ok, wait
[12:14:00] <zetok> I'd have to add like most of people present, given that most of them do/did contribute to qTox in one way or another
[12:14:01] <sudden6> actually this can be seen in the logs
[12:14:10] <zetok> + ↑ yeah
[12:14:59] <sudden6> then it's ok for me
[12:15:04] <zetok> ok
[12:19:35] <sudden6> PafXUS: I see what you mean now
[12:20:32] <sudden6> I think it's just that the code didn't get reviewed very toroughly
[12:21:51] <sudden6> If you think it improves things when using const ref feel free to submit a PR
[12:22:01] <PafXUS> In my case what question is all about - should i invest my time fixing this problem (i think this IS important) - and will it agreed as PR, or this will be rejected as non-relevant.
[12:22:43] <PafXUS> Okay, next question - how large should it be? for example - project now have like 500-1000 places where this problem occure, how should i split it?
[12:25:38] *** Joins: anoadragon (~rainbow@ )
[12:25:46] <sudden6> PafXUS: maybe start with a small PR under [WIP] tags describing your idea/goal and if everybody agrees, expand it
[12:26:15] <PafXUS> okay, thanks alot
[12:26:49] <sudden6> I'd like to hear opinions from more experienced C++ programmers on this tough
[12:27:55] <zero-ghost> https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/startup-offers-to-provide-social-media-surveillance-for-landlords-vgtrn
[12:34:01] <PafXUS> sudden6: For me logic is based upon 2 things, first have nothing to do with Qt, and apply to c++ types in general (I bet Bjarne Stroustrup is expirienced enough): https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rf-in  ,next thing - okay there is Qt magick world with implicit sharing, if it works nice for this kind of situations, Qt library should pass parameters by value itself all ower the place.Which it don
[12:36:51] <sudden6> well, I actually meant more experienced than me, which is probably everyone in qTox ;)
[12:38:11] <PafXUS> okay) i'll choose some part of qTox - and make PR as you suggested
[12:38:31] <sudden6> ok :)
[12:39:36] <cisc> better if the problem (if there is one) got fixed now then later down the road..

[13:11:04] <zetok> hm, 16.04.1 also doesn't work
[13:12:05] <sudden6> lucky me does updates only on friday/saturday^^
[13:13:11] <cisc> was fairly easy to fix, but left a lot of users not being able to login
[13:13:18] <cisc> or no network, no sound
[13:14:24] <zetok> lol
[13:15:05] <sudden6> no network is always a pain, I usually have to download the fixes over my phone then ...
[13:21:56] <cisc> you just had to add pam_systemd.so back in /etc/pam.d/common-session-pc and reinstall systemd, once you added that string back in common-session-pc you had network. but if you just ran pam-config --add --systemd and then updated to the fixed snapshot (0607), it creates a common-session-pc.rpmsave file as to not wipe out custom entries in there..

[13:27:06] <zetok> ah, scratch it, someone else can go through 1.8k svgs without thumbnails
[13:27:21] <sudden6> what do you want from the svgs?

[16:48:42] <sudden6> will be merged with the next batch
[16:50:52] <zetok> :D
[16:55:41] <sudden6> how came qTox now has a four digit version number?^^
[16:56:14] <zetok> there was needed tag for osx release
[16:58:06] <zetok> and since no code in qTox itself was changed IMO 1.4.2 wouldn't be a good thing
[16:59:30] <cisc> so since Ubuntu is a piece of trash the qTox window doesn't show up
[16:59:39] <zetok> :D
[16:59:55] <zetok> cisc: we've just talked about sudden6 merging PR that would work around it :D
[17:01:16] <cisc> well I wanted two ways all along to open qTox
[17:01:48] <cisc> looks like Ubuntu users will have only 1 for the time being though, after the PR gets merged
[17:01:57] <cisc> (from the tray)
[17:02:52] <zetok> um, mind reminding what was the other one?
[17:03:45] <cisc> left-clicking on the tray icon opens it on KDE for me
[17:04:58] <sudden6> zetok: I'd still prefer to stick to three digits, even if nothing really changed
[17:05:43] <sudden6> cisc: did you try on newest Ubuntu? I tested it there with Unity and it worked normally, older versions not so much
[17:06:22] <cisc> sudden6: no.. not yet
[17:06:30] <zetok> sudden6: would "bugfix" release really be good to be used for something that doesn't even touch qTox code?
