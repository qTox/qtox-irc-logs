[10:54:09] <Ssaamm> By chance, UI stands for User Interface?
[10:57:25] <zetok> yep
[11:00:41] <Ssaamm> Thank you ;)
[11:02:26] <Ssaamm> Hum... before adding a new issue, I have a little question
[11:03:16] <Ssaamm> I do not know how qTox is built, I don't know its infrastructure, and I can't know by myself as I don't code C/C++/etc.
[11:04:42] <Ssaamm> But in a vision where the user could personnalize the interface
[11:05:23] <Ssaamm> Is it complicated to put, for example, background colors as a variable which can be easily change by the user?
[11:06:07] <Ssaamm> For now, it is possible to choose 5 different backgrounds, but let's imagine a user wants a different tone of blue...
[11:07:16] <Ssaamm> Would it be technically really difficult to write, according on how the software is currently written, or it's not this difficult and requires only a bit amount of time? :3
[11:07:23] <Chiitoo> Ssaamm: See for example(s) perhaps https://github.com/tux3/qTox/pull/1882
[11:08:18] <Ssaamm> Thanks, I'm reading it
[11:09:42] <Chiitoo> Sadly things are hard-coded currently, so a user needs to change the colours in the code and rebuild qTox to change them, so quite a bit more than a bit of coding needs to be done to make it possible via settings.
[11:10:05] <Chiitoo> And as can be seen there, lots of effort was already put into it, but it never got merged in the end.
[11:11:44] <Ssaamm> Hum, I see
[11:13:35] <Ssaamm> They are talking about CSS
[11:13:59] <Ssaamm> I didn't know CSS could be used for softwares, I only use it for webpages... OÃ´
[11:14:12] <Chiitoo> Hehe.
[11:15:16] <Chiitoo> Indeed Qt makes use of a similar approach: http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/stylesheet.html
[11:17:35] <Ssaamm> By chance, do you know where are the folders of the different themes? 
[11:20:19] <Chiitoo> The current ones?  I never actually looked into that (I only changed the hard-coded values), but I believe they make use of the colours in 'style.cpp' ( https://github.com/tux3/qTox/blob/master/src/widget/style.cpp ).  I'm not entirely sure though.
[11:21:48] <Chiitoo> The css-files are under 'ui' ( https://github.com/tux3/qTox/tree/master/ui ).
[11:38:12] <Ssaamm> Well... it sucks because I do have some ideas to personnalize qTox... and I don't know HOW to do it 8)
[11:39:07] <Ssaamm> I've seen a bunch of the css files
[11:39:21] <Ssaamm> But I don't know to what they are related...
[11:39:35] <Ssaamm> I'm gonna keep searching

[18:28:28] <cisc> friend on Windows can't send me a file or screenshot to my Linux qtox, it just hangs but I can send them files/screenshots
[18:28:54] *** Quits: st4ll1 (~st4ll1@ ) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[18:29:01] <cisc> it will hang, then friend goes offline for a sec, reappears then box turns from green to red
[18:31:41] <zetok> huh
[18:31:45] <zetok> when exactly it hangs?
[18:34:52] <cisc> they send me a screenie and it doesn't even send 1 byte, sits there for 15~ seconds, then friend goes offline & comes back on
[18:35:42] <zetok> on qTox >= 1.4 ?

[18:45:34] <zetok> does your friend mind making an issue?
[18:47:01] <cisc> ill ask
[18:47:24] <cisc> strange though b/c this seems to be a new issue, before it was fine

[19:22:03] <cisc> VPN is a factor it seems
[19:22:19] <cisc> but only with 1 person on Windows
[19:25:20] <zetok> >_>

[19:46:16] <cisc> 1 person can send me files while on VPN w/o issue on qtox, the other can't. When I drop the VPN they can send files so I don't know if it's qtox or the VPN causing it
[19:47:45] <cisc> im going to try going over TCP instead
[19:49:38] <zetok> if it works without vpn, it's vpn
[19:49:50] <cisc> ok so it's UDP+VPN that doesn't work
[19:49:59] <cisc> but TCP mode does work
[19:50:01] <zetok> no, it's your vpn being broken
[19:50:07] <cisc> lol
[19:50:25] <cisc> i'll have to find out why
[19:50:39] <zetok> it cannot into UDP
[19:51:09] <cisc> then why would Mumble work
[19:51:19] <zetok> or rather, it starts dropping too many UDP packets when there's more data transfer, which results in what you had
[19:51:22] <cisc> and voice calls over UDP
[19:51:31] <cisc> via qtox
[19:52:04] <cisc> im going to try a different VPN provider now and see
[19:52:58] <cisc> brb
[19:53:00] <zetok> with that being said, qTox could make some use of resuming file transfers
