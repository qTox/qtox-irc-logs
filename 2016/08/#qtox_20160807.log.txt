[04:13:02] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] antis81 closed pull request #3564: [WIP] create forms in the requested context (master...settings-ui) https://git.io/v63w8
[05:00:37] <Emcy_> wy does the stable pkg release on jenkins get rebuilt with new commits
[05:01:00] <Emcy_> shouldnt it get rebuilt only on a stable tag
[05:03:21] <Emcy_> does it depend on what build scripts say or something
[05:03:35] <Emcy_> does it just get rebuilt with no changes all the time
[05:08:18] <nurupo> hm
[05:08:35] <nurupo> apparently me updating libsodium on jenkins triggered that
[05:09:00] <nurupo> tux3: didn't you say it was fine to update libraries? :P ^
[05:09:16] <nurupo> Emcy_: here is the reason why it has triggered explained in details https://build.tox.chat/view/qtox/job/qTox_pkg_windows_x86-64_stable_release/415/
[05:10:22] <nurupo> nurupo -> sodium_src -> libsodium_build_windows_x86-64_static_release -> qTox-updater_build_windows_x86-64_release -> qTox_pkg_windows_x86-64_stable_release
[05:10:52] <Emcy_> what has qtox updater got to do with libsodium
[05:11:54] <nurupo> i believe the updates are signed by tux3
[05:12:01] <Emcy_> p cool to see exactly why that happened
[05:12:08] <nurupo> so the updater needs sodium to verify the signature
[05:12:27] <Emcy_> oh thats smart
[05:13:14] <Emcy_> the nightly built 5 hrs ago is bashed on a commit from days ago
[05:13:29] <Emcy_> so it doesnt rebuild on every commit i guess
[05:17:07] <nurupo> which nightly?
[05:17:48] <nurupo> yeah, it's because i was updating libraries today
[05:17:58] <nurupo> opus, vpx, sodium, ffmpeg
[05:18:19] <nurupo> so the downstream jobs all got rebuilt
[05:18:48] <Emcy_> do dependencies have to be refreshed manually
[05:18:53] <nurupo> was there a commit made to qtox less than 5h ago?
[05:19:13] <nurupo> Emcy_: yes, because we pull stable releases
[05:19:29] <Emcy_> ok
[05:19:34] <nurupo> they are used only in windows builds and static linux build though
[05:20:16] <nurupo> the deb pacakges depend on libraries provided by the target distros
[05:21:06] <Emcy_> even libsodium?
[05:21:49] <Emcy_> hm i remember bitcoin devs having to fight debian like hell NOT to package bitcoin themselves like that
[05:21:59] <nurupo> i think so
[05:22:17] <Emcy_> because its very important everything is static linked and exactly the same everywhere

[09:48:36] <zetok> initramfs: I've sent you invite to qTox org
[09:49:27] <zetok> initramfs: what are the steps when it comes to merging PR?
[09:49:49] <initramfs> Lol, is this a test
[09:49:57] <zetok> ~yep
[09:50:01] <initramfs> Well, review on reviewable first
[09:50:05] <initramfs> lgtm, when reviewed
[09:50:24] <initramfs> Run through the test_pr script and finally the merge pr script
[09:50:42] <initramfs> Also, make sure gpg sign is configured
[09:51:10] <zetok> ok
[09:51:35] <initramfs> (and of course, obvious checks like does the commit scope match what the commit does, etc)
[09:52:13] <zetok> 3 notes
[09:53:04] <zetok> test-pr.sh doesn't do anything beside merging stuff into `test1234` branch, so it's there only to ease testing, you don't have to use it, but PR has to be tested to be merged on master
[09:53:28] <zetok> 2. it's preferable to wait some time before merging a PR, to let other people comment about stuff
[09:54:29] <zetok> 3. even if GPG-signing is configured, it's usually a good thing to check whether it actually works – antis81 had a case where stable git 2.9 ignored GPG-signing option, which resulted in an unsigned commit
[09:55:04] <initramfs> Yep okay, got it
[09:55:13] <zetok> when it comes to your own PRs, you don't need to run merge-pr.sh scrip, but your commits have to be GPG-signed
[09:55:19] <zetok> script*
[09:55:52] <zetok> `logs = log --show-signature` ← useful alias to have in .gitconfig
[09:56:43] <initramfs> Oh, one thing to note, when merging other people's PRs merge-pr.sh will actually cause the merge right?
[09:57:07] <initramfs> Because I think a helpful line to add to MAINTAINING.md is to not use the reviewable merge feature
[09:57:11] <initramfs> Since it won't use the script
[09:58:22] <zetok> oh, right
[09:58:44] <zetok> >Oh, one thing to note, when merging other people's PRs merge-pr.sh will actually cause the merge right?
[09:59:09] <zetok> it will merge it locally, and print commands to push it to remote, or remove local merge if you don't like the result
[09:59:26] <initramfs> Okay, that sounds good
[10:02:37] <initramfs> Just for reference, how long do you usually wait for a PR? 3 days?
[10:02:59] <initramfs> As in before, merging (since the PRs creation)
[10:03:48] <zetok> so, the usual wait is quite long, but it's way longer than it should be
[10:04:04] <zetok> waiting a day before merging a PR is usually good
[10:04:10] <initramfs> Okay
[10:04:36] <zetok> (the long wait is caused by people not having enough time to review & merge stuff)
[10:12:07] <zetok> ok, I think that I've worked around reviewable's desire to merge stuff
[10:13:28] <zetok> and just to be sure I've removed reviewable's permission to push to repo
[10:13:32] <zetok> :3
[10:14:29] <zetok> tux3: btw, I'm removing gitcop hook, since it's not needed by now

[15:47:50] <initramfs> Since the introduction of reviewable.io, does the "pr-changes-required" label mean anything (i.e. should it still be issued)? Since all PRs are essentially "changes-required" until it passes reviewable, which is enforced by the GH merge conditions check.

[19:33:40] <zetok> um, regarding what?
[19:33:44] <zetok> LGTM?
[19:34:21] <zetok> dual purpose – it is used to verify that code has been reviewed, and is a clear message that it's good to be merged
[19:37:45] <Emcy> qtox has a specific system for code review?
