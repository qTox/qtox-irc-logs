[12:12:15] <pcre> zetok: maybe. 
[12:12:32] <zetok> oh?
[12:12:35] <zetok> written in Rust?
[12:13:10] <pcre> No. 
[12:13:32] <Diadl0> I never thinking before, that people want so many strange features
[12:13:35] <pcre> I did not implement it. Just piped it through
[12:13:42] <pcre> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleverbot
[12:14:47] <pcre> I think it is written in D
[12:15:07] <zetok> pcre: um, isn't that proprietary?
[12:15:17] <pcre> Or was it Go
[12:16:25] <zetok> Diadl0: most of features aren't really strange, just the proposed implementations of general ideas are usually a bit off
[12:16:30] <pcre> I dont know for sure. Just testing some AI chat bots.
[12:19:18] <Diadl0> For me it still a lot :)
