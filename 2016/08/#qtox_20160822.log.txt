[20:35:26] <zetok> right
[20:35:37] <bashrc_> I'm guessing that it might be lack of libmjpeg-dev
[20:35:46] <zetok> um
[20:36:04] <zetok> is it a suggested package for ffmpeg?
[20:36:24] <bashrc_> it looks like it's picking a camera format which uses mjpeg

[20:47:13] <bashrc_> does ffmpeg have an mjpeg config option?
[20:55:31] <iphy> I'm not sure the reviewable "any file modified in rebase invalidates LGTM" is that useful
[20:56:07] <iphy> I'd like it to only invalidate if the relative diff changes

[21:01:50] <zetok> iphy: is there an option for it?
[21:01:57] <zetok> (I didn't see one?)
[21:02:40] <zetok> bashrc_: ffmpeg is what handles camera stuff, and since it at least detects mjpeg I would think that it does
[21:06:45] <initramfs> bashrc_: Where are you seeing this "no such input format"? Where is it originating from?
[21:15:56] <bashrc_> from running qtox in a terminal and watching the debug when I select a camera
[21:16:12] <bashrc_> I can see that it finds various formats
[21:16:38] <bashrc_> some yuyv422, some mjpeg

[22:01:08] <iphy> zetok: you're not on tox
