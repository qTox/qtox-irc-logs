[09:45:30] <iphy> The main issue I have with fix GUI PRs is that they are not automatically tested
[09:47:17] <iphy> If your code is higher quality, you need fewer tests
[09:47:41] <iphy> qTox code isn't high quality and there are no tests
[09:47:53] <iphy> That makes me uncomfortable
[09:48:36] <iphy> A fix like this should have a regression test

[10:05:09] <Diadlo> Oh.. sorry august :)

[10:09:25] <Diadlo> I want try with Google test
[10:09:49] <Diadlo> > Which parts will you test first?
[10:09:50] <Diadlo> This part has not pondered
[10:10:12] <iphy> What's your goal?
[10:11:19] <Diadlo> Step by step create test for most part of project -> Make easier bug search
[10:11:33] <iphy> What's your success metric?
[10:12:34] <BiTOk_> coverage percent?
[10:12:47] <iphy> For example
[10:12:53] <Diadlo> At least 50% сode coverage 
[10:12:59] <iphy> OK
[10:13:07] <iphy> How will you measure it?
[10:13:56] <Diadlo> I not sure, but I think, google testing framework has tools to measure it
[10:14:19] <iphy> I don't think so
[10:15:21] <Diadlo> Why? CppUnit use gcov
[10:16:13] <Diadlo> I beleve, that GTF (google testing framework) useing something like that

[10:17:35] <iphy> Good :)
[10:18:45] <Diadlo> But I want you to know: I have little experience in creating tests
[10:21:57] <iphy> that's fine :)

[10:29:44] <bashrc_> anyone know if Qt5 has a dialog for selecting images?

[14:58:18] <zetok> It would be nice to have, but getting to configure it looks like a lot of pain
[14:59:01] <zetok> i.e. lots of reading of existing styles, and perhaps adjusting existing style if it won't perfectly fit in with current qTox style

[17:05:54] <iphy> so no
[17:06:51] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#coding-style
[17:07:18] <iphy> cool, a coding style with no reasoning
[17:07:57] <iphy> so I assume it's a completely unreasonable "feeling" of some random person that caused this style?
[17:08:24] <zetok> partly
[17:08:45] <iphy> it's also fairly incomplete
[17:08:55] <iphy> "const before or after type name?"
[17:09:03] <iphy> apparently before, but why?
[17:10:28] <zetok> the vertical alignment of matching {} was argued to make it more clear what parts of the code are within it
[17:11:39] <zetok> + no {} for single-line `if/etc`, since they're unnecessary
[17:11:55] <zetok> dunno about the rest
[17:12:31] <zetok> i.e. I've just tried to get anything that could resemble a style into the docs, since as I was told, consistency is most important

[19:48:52] <zetok> perhaps docs could say that more than once
[19:48:54] <zetok> btw
[19:49:08] <sudden6> or as another idea, define some scopes, because else we'll have "settingswidget" "settings"
[19:49:10] <sudden6> ...
[19:49:40] <zetok> right
[19:49:50] <zetok> the example scopes in docs could be improved

[19:50:27] <sudden6> anyway this would have to be done in another pr, so lgtm it is
