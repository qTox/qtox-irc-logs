[00:02:35] <oranges> yes the update server
[00:02:45] <oranges> just wanted to check
[00:03:44] <tux3> Yeah, it shouldn't need any updating until the next qTox version comes out :)
[00:04:58] <tux3> Well, I'll do a manual update anyways to be sure.

[22:38:15] <iphy> time to rebase
[23:15:51] <iphy> the "special osx release 1.5.1" doesn't work
[23:18:42] <initramfs> ?
[23:37:21] <iphy> Segfault or missing lib depending on what's installed on your system
[23:37:44] <iphy> It works if you manually fix up the rpaths in the binaries
