[11:59:13] <iphy> IRC sync bot looks broken
[11:59:29] <iphy> I can't see zetok's messages
[11:59:37] <qTox-syncbot> Zetok\0: ;)
[12:00:09] <zetok> bot was just pushing nick + message ~verbatim from groupchat to IRC
[12:00:43] <zetok> and IRC just doesn't like my null, so now I'm "escaping" it in messages sent to IRC

[22:23:13] <Diadlo> zetok: Why we store opened upstream issues?
[22:24:10] <zetok> because they affect users
[22:24:35] <Diadlo> But we can't fix it
[22:24:39] <zetok> so?
[22:24:57] <Diadlo> Hm... I think, that `issues` it's qTox issues :)
[22:25:11] <zetok> yes, and upstream issues are qTox issues
[22:25:12] <Diadlo> Nevermind :)

[22:25:24] <Diadlo> And about https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3664
[22:25:39] <Diadlo> I think, it's correct behaviour
[22:25:43] <zetok> nope
[22:25:48] <Diadlo> Why?
[22:25:50] <zetok> aliases should be stored in the DB
[22:25:56] <Diadlo> Ok
[22:25:58] <zetok> same goes for other stuff
[22:27:14] <zetok> btw, about 2-year-deprecation period â€“ this is something that IMO is needed only when it comes to code that ensures backwards compatibility with user data
[22:28:31] <Diadlo> What the reason to store deprecated code, if it isn't ensures backwards compatibility?)
[22:29:16] <zetok> right :)
[22:30:04] <zetok> um, the other way to go about it, as I've mentioned before, is to extract deprecated code into a separate tool
[22:30:21] <Diadlo> Yep
[22:30:42] <zetok> which probably is what going to be needed in future migrations when there will be more people using qTox, and they will need more time to migrate their data
