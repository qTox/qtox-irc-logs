[01:20:45] <nurupo> that's weird
[01:23:22] <linuxmodder> nurupo,  any windows version needed in partilar ?  I have a win 10 on a backup drive I could test on later 
[01:23:47] <nurupo> tux3: why there is "qTox_pkg_windows_x86-64_nightly_release" but no "qTox_pkg_windows_x86_nightly_release" ?
[01:24:39] <nurupo> any windows version. test these two qtoxes https://build.tox.chat/view/qtox/job/qTox_build_windows_x86-64_release/ https://build.tox.chat/view/qtox/job/qTox_build_windows_x86_release/
[01:25:00] <nurupo> we didn't update libraries in a long time, just want to make sure the update didn't break anything
[01:33:06] <nurupo> hm
[01:33:46] <nurupo> just tested qTox_build_windows_x86-64_release, seems to work fine
[01:34:23] <nurupo> in the About page, it says that it's based on this commit https://github.com/qTox/qTox/commit/fca278f334595ba93db3379dce02848fe02dfde6

[01:38:33] <nurupo> zetok: do you happen to know if qtox builds with the latest ffmpeg 3.1.* or only 2.* versions can be used?
[02:14:49] <Emcy> nightly is running for me
[02:15:36] <Emcy> is libvpx still slow shit anyway

[06:50:41] <nurupo> ok
[06:51:32] <nurupo> tux3: permission to up ffmpeg to 3.1 on jenkins?
[06:52:23] <nurupo> i hope he actually reads all the highlights at the end of the week...
[06:57:15] <zetok> default znc config doesn't forward highlights..
[06:58:00] <zetok> so it's probably more likely that the answer will come ~fast, or not a all :|

[09:52:55] <tux3> >nurupo> tux3: permission to up ffmpeg to 3.1 on jenkins? <-- Yes!
[09:53:03] <tux3> ><zetok> default znc config doesn't forward highlights.. <-- It does!
[09:53:12] <tux3> Or at least, my xchat picks up on it
[09:53:26] <zetok> oh?
[09:53:27] <tux3> Also, hi
[09:53:30] <zetok> hello :)
[09:54:19] <zetok> znc does the backlog thing, but it doesn't forward just all highlights
[09:54:31] <zetok> unless I've missed an option..
[09:55:06] <tux3> I think xchat just auto-highlights my name
[09:55:17] <tux3> Just does a dump grep in the backlog
[09:56:04] <tux3> A bonus of switching to qTox/qTox is now I don't get highlighted everytime someone links to an issue or PR :)
[09:56:08] *** Joins: abbat (~abbat@ )
[09:56:19] <zetok> :)
[09:59:00] <zetok> well, my point being is that znc would only backlog messages from channel up to the limit, and then it would start dropping oldest ones, including "highlights"

[10:55:11] <zetok> antis81 broke master again
[10:56:22] <tux3> Uh, what's wrong with the commit format here?
[10:56:30] <zetok> ?
[10:56:36] <zetok> what do you mean?
[10:56:41] <tux3> Why is it breaking?

[10:58:08] <zetok> no GPG signature and message is too long

[10:58:52] <tux3> No GPG sig didn't seem to break https://github.com/qTox/qTox/commit/b71c919f2a5cc92cdb8c0f7b0d3a76e268244549
[10:59:23] <zetok> yes, GPG is not being being checked right now
[11:00:01] <tux3> Maybe we need to make some Git hooks to catch errors before pushing, because clearly the commit name rules are pretty hard to follow in practice :/
[11:01:30] <zetok> :s
[11:01:53] <zetok> the problem here is that it was merged via reviewable
[11:03:08] <zetok> something that I thought shouldn't be possible

[11:04:16] <zetok> I've de-selected that option in settings

[20:44:30] <nurupo> did you do the switch?
[20:44:54] <tux3> Nope, I'm about to unless you want to :)
[20:44:59] <nurupo> because commits to qtox/qtox didn't trigger nightlies 24 hours ago
[20:45:13] <nurupo> you ened to setup a webhook for junkins in repo's settings

[20:50:15] <nurupo> tux3: btw, if you are missing out on log, you can either increase # of lines to backlog for a channel or you can request more of backlog for a channel be talking to one of *plugins
[20:50:24] <sudden6> tux3: hi, do you know the toxID of antis81?
[20:51:33] <nurupo> i usually just set it to 5000 lines for channels i care about, which is usually enough for a day or two of being afk, sometimes longer
[20:52:08] <tux3> nurupo, how do you set it?
[20:52:11] <nurupo> your irc client might lag a bit when you conenct to znc, as it will receive all those lines to you :P
[20:52:26] <tux3> sudden6, nope, sorry
[20:54:08] <nurupo> tux3: in web interface, on Your Settings page, at the very bottom you can set the default value in "Buffer Size:"
[20:54:35] <nurupo> tux3: and if you Edit the network, you can set limit per channel
[20:55:08] <tux3> augh, I got locked out of the web interface :)
[20:55:11] <nurupo> i keep the default and set high number on per-channel basis
[20:55:37] <nurupo> you might be able to do it through irc interface, but i'm not that familiar with it
[20:56:40] <nurupo> ><*status> | SetBuffer              | <#chan> [linecount]                   | Set the buffer count for a channel
[20:58:41] <tux3> Seems to have worked, thanks!
[21:02:36] <nurupo> tux3: have you seen my email?
[21:03:31] <tux3> nurupo, yeah, I looked at it again and it seems your script is good thanks to the -L option
[21:03:43] <nurupo> hm
[21:03:49] <tux3> Or at least, I couldn't figure out an easy way to break it :)
[21:03:53] <nurupo> you were saying the opposite though
[21:04:13] <tux3> I got it because I could send arbitrary rsync commands, so I could do "rsync -l"
[21:04:31] <nurupo> can you give me a working script with any command?
[21:04:32] <tux3> Your "rsync -L" seems to be protecting the script pretty well though
[21:04:50] <nurupo> e.g. even without -L
[21:05:00] <tux3> Well, yeah. But that only works if you have root@build.tox.chat's SSH secret key
[21:05:13] <nurupo> i don't care
[21:05:36] <tux3> Ok one sec, I erased my log behind me so I actually forgot what I did, but I'll reinvent it :)
[21:06:00] <tux3> Did you remove my key in jenkins's authorized_keys btw?
[21:06:14] <nurupo> yes
[21:06:20] <tux3> ok, good :
[21:18:23] <zetok> sudden6: if you want I'll pass your ID to antis81 (via faux offline message)
[21:18:33] <zetok> sudden6: he's not often online though
[21:19:02] <sudden6> zetok: yeah, would be cool

[22:12:19] <nurupo> hm
[22:12:41] <nurupo> tux3: why is qtox binary ~17mb in shared windows build?
[22:13:21] <nurupo> are there really ~15mb of resources (sounds, images, etc) embedded into the binary?
[22:14:37] <tux3> nurupo, we have a lot of emojis I guess
[22:15:01] <zetok> only 7MB, and that's uncompressed
[22:17:06] <nurupo> in my experience with dynamically linked Qt, the .exe binary usually turns out to be <1mb
[22:17:19] <zetok> ha. ha.
[22:17:27] <nurupo> i guess there are some libraries that it statically linked
[22:17:40] <zetok> 6,4M    /usr/bin/qtox
[22:18:12] <nurupo> i'm talking about windows >.exe
[22:18:24] <nurupo> though i would expect the same apply for linux
[22:19:19] <zetok> perhaps that's the case for very simple programs
[22:19:55] <tux3> Ok lemme check
[22:20:27] <Chiitoo> Not sure I would call 7MB 'only' there, heh.  Then again, I'd prefer them being an optional thing to install at all.  :D
[22:20:32] <nurupo> zetok: ones without resources and without any statically linked libraries
[22:20:51] <tux3> Sur le window x64, on � 12MB de .text, 3MB de .bss and 5MB de .rdata, donc principalement c'est le code qui prend >60% de la place
[22:21:13] <tux3> Fuck, the same in english
[22:21:21] <tux3> We have 12MB of code, 3+5 MB of data
[22:21:26] <tux3> So something must be statically linked
[22:21:59] <nurupo> yeah, you link against toxcore, sodium, vpx, sqlcipher, qrencode, opus, filteraudio and ffmpeg statically
[22:22:16] <zetok> \o/
[22:22:17] <nurupo> that explains why the binary so big
