[00:44:14] <iphy> hi
[00:44:17] <iphy> any windows users around?
[00:44:31] <iphy> or someone who has access to a windows machine
[00:44:37] <iphy> or VM
[00:45:15] <iphy> http://toktok.github.io/client/windows/qtox.zip <- please test the static windows build
[00:45:50] <iphy> it probably doesn't work correctly because of plugins, but I'd like to know what it looks like and in what way it doesn't work
[00:51:16] <Emcy_> whats this
[00:54:47] <iphy> cross compiled qtox using mingw
[00:55:36] <Emcy_> big file
[00:55:59] <iphy> it's statically linked
[00:56:18] <Emcy_> how is it different to what qtox already does
[00:56:57] <iphy> hopefully it's not
[00:57:10] <Emcy_> doesnt load
[00:57:20] <iphy> ok, thanks, that's enough then
[00:57:31] <Emcy_> couldnt find qt plugin "windows"
[00:57:40] <iphy> I see
[00:57:43] <Emcy_> whatever the fuck that means
[00:57:51] <iphy> I know what that means
[00:57:53] <iphy> I'll fix it

[01:17:15] <Emcy> if hstox is the reimplementation wtf is toktok
[01:18:07] <iphy> toktok was the android client reimpl
[01:18:17] <iphy> a gsoc project that is now on hold
[01:18:40] <iphy> then I just took the name and made it the "working on toxcore" thing
[01:18:57] <iphy> with the plan outlined in a document I shared around a couple of months ago
[01:19:35] <Emcy> why haskel
[01:21:34] <iphy> explained here: https://toktok.github.io/design/testing
[01:22:53] <Emcy> kinda fucked up
[01:22:58] <Emcy> some missing ui elements
[01:24:11] <iphy> OK that's kind of expected
[01:24:21] <iphy> Thanks
[01:24:40] <Emcy> ausio works
[01:27:04] <iphy> Images might not work at all
[01:27:12] <iphy> Because of missing plugins
[01:27:14] <Emcy> what images
[01:28:45] <iphy> Avatars?
[01:29:21] <Emcy> some work
[01:30:04] <iphy> Hmm ok
[01:30:37] <iphy> Thanks for testing, I know roughly what needs to be done but I'll wait for tux3 
[01:50:51] <Emcy> its like ui elements are missing or corrupted sometimes
[01:51:07] <Emcy> everything else is same i think
[01:55:16] <Emcy> nah it crashed that time

[11:33:13] <zetok> would there be an interest in qTox one?

[11:34:10] *** Quits: f10__ (~flo@ ) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[11:35:21] <zetok> the question is, would there be enough of other people who would be interested too to justify the effort of making a bot (modifying current one) & maintaining it for qTox?
[11:36:44] <zetok> also, current groupchats are not really a that good if even one of participants decides to make things worse for everyone else
[11:36:58] <zetok> s/a that/that/
[11:40:43] *** Quits: wangbin (~wangbin@ ) (Quit: leaving)
[11:57:48] <iphy> how about the new group chats?
[11:58:04] <iphy> will someone shepherd them through the review process?
[11:58:25] <iphy> zetok: I have an osx build now
[11:58:52] <zetok> >will someone shepherd them through the review process?
[11:59:16] <zetok> um, as soon as they will be in usable state there will be no reason to not run them
[11:59:30] <iphy> are they less usable than the current ones?
[11:59:34] <zetok> yep
[11:59:40] <iphy> why?
[11:59:45] <zetok> since they have no support for audio and TCP-only mode
[12:00:27] <iphy> is TCP only mode used a lot?
[12:00:42] <zetok> not by me personally, but lots of people use it
[12:00:49] <iphy> ok
[12:00:52] <iphy> why?
[12:00:53] <iphy> because tor?
[12:01:08] <zetok> yes, and because that's what toxcore uses when UDP can't be used on a restrictive network
[12:01:23] <iphy> ok, and many people are on restrictive networks?
[12:01:27] <zetok> lots
[12:01:39] <iphy> ok
[12:01:46] <iphy> https://travis-ci.org/iphydf/qTox/jobs/151470281
[12:01:52] <iphy> soon :)
[12:02:06] <iphy> 4 minutes from now I'll hopefully have a working osx build
[12:02:12] <zetok> back in the day, when current groupchats didn't have TCP support there were lots of people complaining that groupchats don't work at all
[12:02:17] <zetok> \o/
[12:02:36] <zetok> probably something around 30% of people who were interested in using groupchats
[12:02:42] <zetok> (if not more)
[12:03:25] <zetok> actually, back in the day I too needed to use TCP-only mode on a restricted network, but toxcore didn't have support for it yet :c
[12:03:38] <zetok> those were sad days
[12:04:07] <iphy> build is done
[12:04:52] <iphy> sadness!
[12:05:06] <iphy> "toxcore failed to start" - wut?
[12:06:51] <iphy> uhm
[12:07:02] <iphy> it hits the default case
[12:10:44] <iphy> trying again
[12:11:04] <iphy> thanks qtox for not telling me *why* it failed to start although toxcore has very nice error codes everywhere
[12:11:28] <iphy> next attempt: https://travis-ci.org/iphydf/qTox/jobs/151473732
[12:11:49] <zetok> um, it sounds like error wasn't recognised
[12:12:19] <iphy> yeah, because the switch doesn't handle all errors
[12:12:25] <zetok> oh.
[12:12:40] <iphy> for some strange reason, the person implementing it decided that not all errors can happen or are important
[12:13:16] <iphy> like, malloc failing? that's impossible! or bad proxy type? I never make coding mistakes, so that can't happen either
[12:14:31] <iphy> 6 minutes then we'll have another build
[12:20:11] <iphy> ok, it's malloc

[21:13:45] <initramfs> zetok: I emailed travis support a few days ago about OSX deployment failures (specifically regarding that issue where dmg creation would randomly fail)
[21:14:04] <initramfs> They've sinced responded with a message for us to update the OSX build image
[21:14:15] <zetok> -.-"
[21:14:18] <initramfs> They claim it's a free space issue
[21:14:51] <zetok> ok, at least there's something that we could try
[21:15:01] <initramfs> I personally know next to nothing about the OSX deployment process, so I don't know what the affects of using a later version of xcode would be
[21:15:33] <initramfs> Should I add to to my PR on auto-docs from travis? Or should I start a new PR based off the changes in the existing PR
[21:15:55] <zetok> new PR
[21:16:07] <initramfs> Also, if anyone (perhaps iphy) knows about the repercussions of the change, it would be nice to know
[21:16:27] <initramfs> zetok: Okay. I'll test it in my fork first for stability
[21:16:41] <initramfs> zetok: Once I verify there are no build-related issues I'll submit a PR
[21:17:35] <zetok> ok
[21:17:38] <initramfs> Also, if someone could fill me in on the OSX build status that would be since. I saw a lot of back and forth conversation about people breaking builds, but I don't know if this corresponds to some past change or something specific to a build right now
[21:17:58] <initramfs> I wasn't really present, kinda just glossed the convo

[21:22:39] <zetok> of the osx binary, I'd guess
[21:24:00] <initramfs> Oh
[21:24:01] <initramfs> I see
[21:24:40] <iphy> Yes
[21:26:12] <zetok> iphy: um, what is your plan regarding changes in fork?
[21:27:18] <iphy> One thing is, I'll be changing the toxcore public API
[21:27:29] <iphy> So I'll update qTox to use it
[21:28:14] <iphy> Other than that I'd like to keep it close to upstream
[21:28:29] <iphy> And make pull requests for things that I think are useful for upstream
[21:29:05] <zetok> I see
[21:29:41] <zetok> tux3: ↑ changes are going to be stateless callbacks, sounds good, right?
[21:30:05] <initramfs> brb restart, shiny new 5.7 kernel
[21:30:28] *** Quits: initramfs (~initramfs@ ) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:30:53] <zetok> tux3: what do you think about switching (at least travis) builds to TokTok/toxcore?
[21:32:16] <zetok> (will probably happen sooner or later, IMO switch could happen ~now)
[21:32:54] <zetok> iphy: ↑ will there be any expectation of stability?
[21:33:19] <zetok> API stability, that is
[21:33:54] <zetok> or rather
[21:33:55] *** Joins: initramfs (~initramfs@ )
[21:34:02] <zetok> what I have in mind are proper versions
[21:34:10] *** Joins: abbat (~abbat@ )
[21:37:02] <iphy> Yes
[21:37:25] <iphy> zetok: not in the next 4 weeks
[21:37:27] <iphy> But the API is good
[21:37:32] <iphy> It was created by smart people
[21:37:45] <iphy> It's a very good C API
[21:38:10] <iphy> I'm going to change only one thing that'll make it a good everything API
[21:38:24] <iphy> Stateless callbacks are the last piece of that puzzle
[21:38:36] <iphy> Once we have that, the API is almost perfect
[21:39:07] <iphy> I need to take a closer look at tox options
[21:39:28] <iphy> I'll need to make sure it has no padding between members
[21:40:01] <iphy> Padding makes life harder for ffi
[21:40:32] <iphy> I think FFI is a very important target for toxcore
[21:40:53] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] zetok pushed 5 new commits to master: https://git.io/v6Rq0
[21:40:53] -qtox-git-spam- qTox/master 51eae5b initramfs: chore(build): deploy doxygen documentation on master branch pushes...
[21:40:53] -qtox-git-spam- qTox/master e124bd8 initramfs: chore(build): parallelize travis and separate out doc build/deploy...
[21:40:53] -qtox-git-spam- qTox/master 80581aa initramfs: chore(build): add an error message on failure to deploy documentation
[21:40:54] <iphy> Making it easy to use the API from other languages is important for adoption
[21:41:13] <zetok> indeed
[21:41:14] <iphy> Public structs make that harder
[21:41:31] <iphy> Because calling conventions are usually well supported in FFI
[21:41:46] <iphy> But creating aggregate structures is not
[21:46:30] <iphy> Stateless callbacks are super important
[21:46:59] <iphy> Think of the implications of handing toxcore a pointer to a data structure in another language
[21:47:04] <iphy> It's nothing but pain
[21:48:03] <iphy> Tox4j jumps through lots of hoops with complex logic to keep track of objects and clean them up correctly when Java GCs them
[21:48:37] <iphy> The tox4j API exposes a clean stateless interface
[21:48:55] <iphy> The next step is to make toxcore expose a similar clean interface
[21:49:07] <iphy> Because at the toxcore level, this is a straightforward change
[21:49:30] <iphy> Making stateful APIs stateless is hard
[21:50:07] <iphy> The change in qtox is trivial
[21:50:25] <iphy> I think 18 lines change in core.cpp
[21:51:00] <iphy> Remove all the passing of this to callback registration, and instead pass this to iterate
[21:51:36] <iphy> Toxic also needs almost no changes because it uses global variables instead of a user data pointer
[21:51:42] <iphy> uTox no idea
[21:52:04] <iphy> Tox4j will need large changes that will get rid of most of the c++ code in it
[21:52:23] <iphy> But I don't care about tox4j at this point because we're not yet targeting android
[21:53:01] <iphy> And even when we do I'm leaning towards using a separate HLAPI and communicating with it via RPC
[21:53:17] <iphy> So no direct tox core API in Java
[21:56:01] <tux3> ><zetok> tux3: ↑ changes are going to be stateless callbacks, sounds good, right? <-- Sounds great, I'm happy to hear that.
[21:56:44] <tux3> ><zetok> tux3: what do you think about switching (at least travis) builds to TokTok/toxcore? <-- I think that we need to switch, but it should be done in coordination with other clients, and it should be done all at once � not just travis.
[21:57:42] <zetok> right
[21:58:18] <zetok> I'd prefer a granular switch, since if something were to start to explode, users wouldn't be affected as much
[21:58:59] <zetok> i.e. switch travis, wait for some time to see if things start to explode, if everything seems to be ok, switch the next thing & look out for explosions, etc
[21:59:30] <tux3> Could we switch travis just for a particular branch first?
[21:59:43] <zetok> um
[22:00:00] <tux3> If travis compiles with new toxcore and jenkins compiles with another toxcore, well I'm worried there could be strange bugs creeping in
[22:00:02] <zetok> travis does whatever .travis.yml states
[22:00:06] <tux3> Hm
[22:00:11] <tux3> So that's not a no, then :) ?
[22:00:30] <zetok> that's a "you need a branch with modified stuff"
[22:00:33] <tux3> Ya
[22:01:03] <tux3> I don't think there's a big risk of things exploding though, but we can do that if you think it's worth it
[22:01:21] <zetok> actually, just 2 steps
[22:01:30] <zetok> travis, wait, ~everything else
[22:02:05] <zetok> the "everything else" might be problematic though
[22:02:21] <zetok> i.e. from packaging perspective
[22:03:02] <zetok> for Slackware, FreeBSD, Gentoo, Arch, perhaps OBS(?)
[22:03:35] <zetok> I mean, it won't be a real problem as long as API won't be changed
[22:03:45] <zetok> but I have a feeling that API is going to be changed soon
[22:04:14] <zetok> the distros I've mentioned above all package irungentoo/toxcore
[22:04:25] <tux3> If the API changes, then let's wait until things stabilize and then we'll do a big flag day switch
[22:04:36] <tux3> With coordination from all the packagers, ideally....
[22:04:47] <tux3> But in the meantime we can set up a new branch, what do you think?
[22:05:04] <zetok> I think that it's not really worth the effort
[22:06:01] <tux3> Fair enough. Let's just wait for a bit then, there's no sense in breaking things now if we'll have to break things again a week from now when the API changes.

[22:06:44] <zetok> ok
[22:07:10] <athan> hi everyone, can someone give me the scoop on why http://tox.im looks like it's been seized?
[22:07:21] <zetok> well, it has been
[22:07:27] <athan> :O
[22:07:38] <athan> from whom exactly? Is there justified reason?
[22:09:41] <zetok> has been "seized" by the blog post author
[22:10:07] <zetok> nothing to do with Tox/qTox by now though
[22:10:16] <iphy> tux3: I think that's reasonable
[22:10:34] <zetok> athan: https://qtox.github.io/ ← qTox does have its own website :P
[22:10:38] <iphy> I keep my fork of qTox in compatibility with my toxcore
[22:12:55] <zetok> athan: as for "reason", the person in question AFAIK spent Tox project money on himself, and was thrown out, and since he was the one who was in control of the domain..
[22:14:10] <athan> zetok: What a sleeze >_> (apologies to any offenses). Thank you for the update
[22:14:33] <athan> Is there an official site for... tox? Or is that tox-core?
[22:15:02] <athan> is there a libtox also? Something that I can make haskell bindings to? :)
[22:15:03] <zetok> there is tox.chat, but there are some issues with it
[22:15:07] <athan> hm
[22:15:13] <zetok> :D
[22:15:16] <zetok> about haskell
[22:15:23] <zetok> athan: there's #toktok
[22:15:39] <zetok> athan: and you would be interested in hstox :)
[22:15:51] <athan> !! I just saw those!
