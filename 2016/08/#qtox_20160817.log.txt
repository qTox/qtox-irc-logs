[13:20:49] <zero-ghost> pcre: you can run your own groupbot
[13:21:52] <pcre> zero-ghost: Do you have a link to where to get the sources?
[13:22:29] <zero-ghost> not off hand, you can ask Jfreegman in the tox channel
[13:23:32] <pcre> ahh. found it. https://github.com/JFreegman/ToxBot
[13:25:06] <pcre> thx

[16:23:54] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] iphydf opened pull request #3633: chore: Improve diagnostics when toxcore failes to initialise. (master...tox-errors) https://git.io/v6ocC
[16:58:42] *** Joins: initramfs (~initramfs@ )
[17:19:30] <iphy> initramfs: why xcode 7.3?
[17:20:09] <initramfs> We've been experiencing random failure from hdiutil (i.e. repeating the same build often causes it to succeed)
[17:20:14] <iphy> I see
[17:20:21] <initramfs> I've contacted travis support about this
[17:20:32] <initramfs> They claim the default images don't have enough space
[17:20:35] <iphy> the toktok/qtox build works every time with hdiutil
[17:20:51] <initramfs> Ehh.. It is rather rare... So I'm not sure...
[17:21:07] <iphy> ok, whatever works :)
[17:21:16] <initramfs> I mean, any harm in using 7.3?
[17:21:35] <iphy> not really, I just like to keep things to default as much as possible
[17:21:41] <initramfs> I see
[17:21:43] <iphy> everything manually configured needs to be manually maintained
[17:22:03] <iphy> manual configuration needs a reason to exist
[17:22:11] <initramfs> I personally know nothing of mac deployment, so I basically just followed the travis support's instructions verbatim
[17:22:26] <iphy> that's fine
[17:22:39] <initramfs> If somehow your builds/toktok builds don't fail, I have no issues going back to whatever default image was used
[17:22:40] <iphy> I don't care that much, since my build ignores those travis changes
[17:23:33] <initramfs> It was just well, the build at it is now is used to generate the mac binaries during a release
[17:23:46] <initramfs> And the travis build failed for v1.5.1 (I had to manually restart the job)
[17:24:17] <initramfs> Though it turned out the OSX builds were broken anyway, the fact that travis could randomly fail to deploy was very concerning
[17:25:57] <iphy> right
[17:27:05] <initramfs> s/at it is/as it is/
