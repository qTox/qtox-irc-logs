[04:49:47] <koshii> Is there any tox project for iOS?
[04:51:30] <koshii> Oh never mind, I see Antidote now
[04:51:40] <koshii> Hmm, I wonder what the challenges are to get this into the Apple app store
[04:55:12] <oranges> having it not drain the phone battery in 30 seconds will likely be important
[04:56:10] <koshii> oranges: Antox on Android isn't too bad, at least on a pretty modern device!
[04:56:20] <koshii> So there's hope, I'd say.

[09:24:38] <iphy> koshii: there are three ways to get it into the app store
[09:25:15] <iphy> 1) violate the GPL or apple tos
[09:25:23] *** Quits: in1t3r (~LordShiva@ ) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:28:16] <iphy> 2) get everybody who contributed code to toxcore to agree to make a GPL exemption (the reverse engineering and free distribution part) for iOS
[09:28:39] <iphy> 3) rewrite toxcore and don't licence that version under GPL
[09:29:33] <jjuran__> Unfreedom sucks.
[09:29:51] <iphy> Right, so 2 is unlikely
[09:41:22] <nurupo> "Unfreedom license, become a slave of your own license" :P
[09:42:20] <nurupo> given how many absurd licenses there are, someone might have actually made an unfreedom license

[20:13:05] <iphy> zetok: is this recursive signal blocking thing really necessary?
[20:13:26] <iphy> "it's a good thing to have, even though it's probably useless at this point" :\
[20:13:46] <iphy> "we don't take the decision to drop support for 5.2 lightly"
[20:17:33] <zetok> no, most likely :(
[20:18:04] <zetok> what is probably useless though?
[20:19:31] <iphy> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3591
[20:19:37] <iphy> "Note Through the recent PR #3590 this might not be required any longer. Anyway such blocker can come in handy in other use cases as well."
[20:21:01] <Diadlo> zetok: https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/issues/1486 closed. Does it means, that https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/2726 no longer "upstream" ?
[20:22:14] <zetok> Diadlo: it is upstream issue, regardless of what upstream wants to believe in
[20:22:33] <Diadlo> Lol
[20:22:44] <zetok> iphy: um, I don't know about C/C++ code
[20:24:06] <zetok> Diadlo: there are actually 2 issues there
[20:25:22] <zetok> one is a toxcore issue, where it cannot into sending messages reliably
[20:25:54] <zetok> the other is a qTox issue, where it sends message duplicates even though it gets confirmations about message's delivery
[20:28:08] *** Joins: pcre (~quassel@ )
[20:28:52] <zetok> Diadlo: the issue in qTox is most likely something in how qTox handles message delivery confirmations
[20:32:28] <iphy> Why can this not happen with uTox?
[20:34:41] <iphy> Why can't it happen with uTox or ricin?
