[06:19:43] <nurupo> ><cisc> zetok: are the jenkins builds going to switch over to the new repo, meaning someone like nurupo is going to make the modification? <-- not really sure what you mean by that. tux3 has access to all qtox jobs on jenkins, so there is no need for me to get involved. also, afaik, tux3's plan was 1) for windows qtox builds -- to keep them on jenkins, as OBS doesn't build for windows 2) for linux qtox builds -- slowly phase out them
[06:22:13] <nurupo> there is also Encrypt guy, he wants to keep qtox linux packages in pkg.tox.chat, he said he will maintain them after tux3 stops doing so
[06:23:48] <nurupo> so there will be qtox linux packages both in OBS and pkg.tox.chat
[06:25:10] <nurupo> i'm a bit annoyed of that idea, because of the duplicate effort, but then again, OBS has utox, toxic and others, which are present on pkg.tox.chat, so there is already duplication going on

[20:53:36] <tux3> So I saw your thing.
[20:53:50] * zetok just finished fixing the script
[20:54:07] <tux3> And apparently everyone agrees we should move to an org, so I guess I'll stop being so stubborn and agree :)
[20:54:20] <tux3> Because maybe I'm wrong
[20:54:30] <zetok> that would be great :)
[20:56:23] *** Joins: in1t3r (~LordShiva@ )
[21:01:09] <tux3> zetok, so you started forking everything in the meantime? :)
[21:01:15] <tux3> What's the plan here?
[21:01:25] <zetok> forking?
[21:01:44] <zetok> so, right
[21:02:16] <zetok> first is the fork under `qTox/`, it was done for iphy to create stuff that you could copy over
[21:02:42] <zetok> but then, you were not interested in copying that, and you're not available to maintain stuff
[21:03:31] <zetok> and you've rejected proposal to move the repo, so I've asked people whether they feel like move should happen, and since there was ~consensus, I saw no point in delaying things, thus I've started looking into copying stuff from the "old" repo
[21:05:19] <zetok> the `import issues` fork is what it says it is, and it was meant mostly for testing, but given how slow & painful it is to import issues, it might not be just for testing, i.e. when things get done once right, it probably would be better to stick to it
[21:05:54] <zetok> the `import` thing will be not needed though if move were to happen :)
[21:11:42] <zetok> tux3: um, if you're trying to move the repo right now, repo from under `qTox/` would need to be moved first
[21:18:30] <zetok> (just say if you want to move, then repo from under `qTox/` could be moved e.g. under `TokTok/` or something
[21:18:31] <zetok> )
[21:19:13] <zetok> i.e. current `qTox/qTox` fork → `TokTok/qTox`; `tux3/qTox` → `qTox/qTox`
[21:20:16] <zetok> (or just move the `qTox/qTox` fork to `TokTok/qTox`
[21:21:10] <zetok> iphy: sorry for moving it like that, I hope that it's not a problem to have a fork there temporarily, until things on `qTox/qTox` main repo won't get set up again?
[21:21:46] <iphy> sure, that's fine
[21:21:57] <tux3> zetok, Sorry I was writing things on GitHub, let me catch up
[21:21:58] <zetok> if tux3 moves the repo I'll recreate setup you did (just with more people allowed to push to master, since qTox kinda needs it)
[21:21:58] <iphy> I don't know what will happen, but go ahead
[21:23:25] <tux3> Okay, so I think the idea would be to move qTox/qTox somewhere else temporarily, and then move tux3/qTox over it. I hope that won't break anything
[21:23:31] <zetok> yep
[21:23:41] <tux3> What would be the purpose of TokTok/qTox?
[21:23:45] <zetok> tux3: you, or me do the `qTox/qTox` move?
[21:23:54] <zetok> tux3: just a place to move the repo to for a moment :)
[21:24:01] <tux3> Whichever :)
[21:24:07] <tux3> As long as we sync up things
[21:24:09] <zetok> ok, you do it :)
[21:24:34] <tux3> Ok, so do you have anything pointed at qTox/qTox right now that might break when we replace it?
[21:24:49] <zetok> I don't
[21:25:15] <tux3> Alright, I'm moving it to TokTok/qTox now
[21:26:10] <tux3> Okay, I don't have the rights apparently, funny how that works :)

[21:26:46] <zetok> oh
[21:26:48] <zetok> right
[21:27:06] <tux3> I think iphy needs to do the move, or give permissions to someone else

[21:55:14] <tux3> iphy, no problem, as long as there's no misunderstanding, just try to be more careful next time :)
[21:55:32] <iphy> sure
[22:07:34] * zetok wonders if reviewable is properly configured
[22:08:04] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3584 ← i.e. I don't see "required LGTMs"

[22:09:30] <tux3> zetok, Is a text LGTM good enough or does that need to be done through reviewables? :)
[22:09:42] <zetok> via reviewable AFAIK
[22:09:50] <zetok> also, `:lgtm:`
[22:10:07] <zetok> (there is handy button for that in reviewable's UI)
[22:10:16] <tux3> (If I didn't know better I'd be tempted to complain about bureaucracy and high barrier to entry!)
[22:11:09] <zetok> >needs :lgtm: & reviewing files (pressing that red button on top of changed file by reviewer (person assigned) for review to pass
[22:11:58] <tux3> Should be good now?
[22:12:02] <zetok> yep, thanks :)
[22:12:32] * zetok will go over current PRs and say that they need to be rebased on current master in order to have checks pass & get merged

[22:33:08] * zetok slow-pokes travis
[22:33:18] <zetok> http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:079Slowpoke.png
[22:33:59] <zetok> weird, build passed, but it still didn't report back on the PR
[22:35:05] <sudden6> maybe it got confused on repo move?
[22:35:14] <zetok> probably
[22:38:42] * zetok wonders if turning it off and on again would help
[22:39:13] <zetok> or should I just wait a bit longer.
[22:39:17] <sudden6> night everybody
[22:39:26] <tux3> night
[22:39:50] <zetok> g'night :)
[22:39:59] <zetok> >There was an error while loading data. 
[22:40:23] <zetok> (when I've tried to open travis settings for qTox/qTox)
[22:40:25] <zetok> great.
[22:43:07] <zetok> ok, now it works
[22:44:22] *** Quits: sudden6 (~anonymous@ ) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)

[22:49:50] <oranges> having mandatory checks incentivises you to improve and fix them when they break
[22:50:07] <oranges> implementing mandatory unit test signoff on code changes in our team was hard work
[22:50:10] <oranges> but we are better for it
[22:53:55] <tux3> I think you're right, but I also think that if you have people that need incentives to fix broken things, it's a sad thing
[22:54:46] <zetok> thing is, people are lazy be default
[22:55:04] <zetok> and thus everyone needs some sort of incentive
[22:55:17] <tux3> Maybe I live in a utopia, where people should learn to only be lazy for things that aren't important
[22:55:27] <oranges> luck you
[22:57:19] <Emcy> qtox still does the thing where your self preview moves around inside the video window
[22:57:45] <Emcy> it should be stuck to the top left
[22:58:00] <zetok> Emcy: mind opening an issue?
[22:58:17] <Emcy> no github account =)
[22:58:33] <zetok> Emcy: you're not willing to make one?
[22:58:41] <Emcy> i might make one again
[22:58:48] <Emcy> later maybe
[22:58:54] <Emcy> its an old bug tho
[22:59:05] <zetok> yes, but so far it wasn't reported
[22:59:20] <Emcy> strange, its really obvious
[22:59:36] <Emcy> it changes soze too like covers 20% of the video window sometimes
[23:02:28] <tux3> oranges, so, I think the incentive should be other people, and not an inflexible system. Because you can't reason with a mandatory check when it's wrong. It sucks if people have to waste time dealing with the system because a mandatory check is broken. Howether if someone accidentally merges something broken, the incentive is that others will notice, don't you think?
[23:02:50] <oranges> no most people don't test the software they use
[23:03:19] <zetok> ↑ same goes for the written code
[23:03:19] <tux3> When I say other people, I mean maintainers and I mean Yours Truly
[23:04:07] <tux3> If you ignore a broken test and you're right, I think everything is fine and you should be allowed. If you ignore a broken test and you're wrong, I think we will need to talk.
[23:04:16] <tux3> No?
[23:05:07] <tux3> I think the difference is that your unit tests don't really fail, so in your case it makes sense. But travis is awful.
[23:05:21] <tux3> If your unit tests fail, you have to fix them. Travis fails when it feels like it.
[23:06:25] *** Quits: Chiitoo (~Chiitoo@ ) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:06:58] <tux3> It's the same with -Werror I think. We don't set it because 1) I trust people to not ignore warnings and 2) It's horribly annoying for everyone when it breaks because a compiler decided to add a new warning. /rant
[23:11:06] *** Quits: BiTOk_ (~BiTOk@ ) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[23:16:35] <zetok> >Travis fails when it feels like it.
[23:16:52] <zetok> um, in qTox's case that's mostly because there are too many "moving pieces"
[23:17:27] <tux3> Well in my experience this isn't limited to qTox :)
[23:17:47] <tux3> Case in point there was the big WebRender2 merge for the awesome Servo engine: https://github.com/servo/webrender/pull/319
[23:17:56] <zetok> right, sometimes travis likes to network timeout
[23:18:43] <iphy> tux3: obviously people ignore warnings
[23:19:03] <tux3> iphy, even maintainers ?
[23:19:05] <iphy> And network timeouts are rare and if they happen you restart the build
[23:19:18] <iphy> tux3: apparently
[23:19:25] <tux3> Maybe I'm too idealistic then
[23:19:43] <iphy> My pending PR is fixing a warning
[23:21:46] <tux3> The one for OS X?
[23:21:56] <iphy> Yes
[23:22:19] <tux3> Yes the thing with warning is everyone doesn't see the same ones apparently
[23:22:46] <tux3> Unless you mean something else
[23:22:58] <iphy> Not returning a value from a non void function is a warning that has been implemented for many many years
[23:23:03] <iphy> In every compiler I know
[23:23:41] <zetok> This is wrong.
[23:23:50] * zetok wonders why no one has made it a hard error
[23:23:56] <Emcy> it doesnt open the camera sometimes hm
[23:24:07] <tux3> iphy, hmm are we talking about the same PR then?
[23:24:14] <tux3> I don't see any C++ code changed in this one
[23:24:23] <tux3> And I don't have a bash compiler :)
[23:24:35] <zetok> tux3: https://github.com/TokTok/qTox/pull/4
[23:25:34] <zetok> i.e. it shouldn't be just a warning, but outright fail to compile if some function that is supposed to return a value doesn't
[23:25:51] <zetok> isn't there a flag for it?
[23:26:09] <tux3> The flag is -Werror, but setting -Werror in production code is a mistake
[23:26:29] <zetok> err?
[23:26:35] <zetok> why?
[23:26:41] <iphy> https://github.com/TokTok/qTox/pull/4
[23:26:55] <tux3> iphy, To be fair that warning is behind a MaxOS specific #ifdef, so you it not everyone would see it here
[23:27:08] <tux3> But I agree that ignoring it is very wrong
[23:27:33] <iphy> It was at least ignored once
[23:27:45] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] zetok pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/v6LzU
[23:27:45] -qtox-git-spam- qTox/master 07ac196 iphydf: chore: Fix Mac OS X build....
[23:27:57] <tux3> zetok, because different compilers implement different warnings, and -Werror would make the build fail at random depending on what compiler you use
[23:28:06] <zetok> -.-
[23:28:11] <zetok> "this is wrong"
[23:28:33] <tux3> Distributing code that FTBFS at random is wrong.
[23:28:43] <zetok> eh
[23:28:54] <zetok> I mean, generally C/C++ is wrong.
[23:28:57] <tux3> -Werror during development is fine, although I wish it weren't needed, but never in code that ships.
[23:29:51] <iphy> -Werror makes sense to enable on Travis
[23:30:07] <tux3> Yes, since Travis only have 10 year old compilers /s :)
[23:30:14] <iphy> Though at the moment it would make it fail
[23:30:35] <tux3> You're right, it would make sense on Travis
[23:30:47] <iphy> Once someone fixes the warning
[23:31:20] <iphy> The deprecation warnings
[23:31:37] -qtox-git-spam- [qTox] initramfs opened pull request #3585: Rewrite all links to the qTox repository from tux3 to qTox (master...fix-tux3-links) https://git.io/v6Lz8
[23:31:52] <iphy> I looked at the code for a few minutes and it's unclear what it does so I stopped wasting time
[23:37:10] <zetok> so, there's this check whether PR is based on latest master
[23:37:49] <zetok> for now it's "on", since none of PRs is going to be merged within an hour or so
[23:38:17] <zetok> bug thing is, requiring ~constant rebases from people doesn't sound quite right
[23:38:21] <tux3> ???
[23:38:26] <tux3> Why would you have a check for that?
[23:38:49] <zetok> iphy: so I'm wondering if there are good reasons to keep it?
[23:39:53] <iphy> Feel free to change it
[23:40:12] <zetok> s/bug thing/but thing/
[23:41:05] <iphy> How do you ensure that the merged code will still pass Travis?
[23:42:20] <tux3> Make travis do the merge instead?
