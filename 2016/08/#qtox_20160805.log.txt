[09:07:49] <nurupo> iphy: not that i know, but depending on what you expect of a formatter, you can "add" one
[09:08:20] <iphy> ideally a nearly canonical format
[09:08:28] <iphy> so any piece of code has exactly one formatting
[09:08:42] <nurupo> you can add an external tool, e.g. astyle or clang-format, through Tools->External->Configure...->Add
[09:09:09] <nurupo> and bind a shortcut for that tool through Tools -> Options -> Environment -> Keyboard
[09:11:29] <nurupo> you can also customize what gets called when you click on Run or Debug, e.g. add an invocation of astyle/clang-format
[09:13:26] <nurupo> that would be in Projects -> Build -> Build Steps
[09:14:41] <nurupo> you could look for or even write yourself a Qt Creator plugin for formatting, if these integrations are limiting :P

[11:26:01] <zetok> zero-ghost: following the trend, eh :/
[11:26:16] <zero-ghost> looks that way
[11:26:17] <zetok> zero-ghost: wasn't it being DMCA'd anyway?
[11:26:41] <zero-ghost> yea they had a policy, when you searched things it said how many results were removed for DMCA at the bottom of the search results
[11:26:51] <zetok> I see
[11:27:47] <zero-ghost> torrentz was my favorite so its sad, but we already have so many potential replacements with more on the way so im really not worried just an annoying inconvenience
[11:27:58] <zetok> oh?
[11:28:03] * zetok haven't heard of any
[11:28:21] <zetok> not that it would change much, since centralized systems are going to fail
[11:28:24] <zero-ghost> someone could just mirror torrentz inside i2p and it wouldnt go down again
[11:28:31] <zero-ghost> yea thats what im saying
[11:28:33] <zetok> oh, this way
[11:28:35] <zero-ghost> im waiting for maidsafe
[11:28:46] *** Parts: initramfs (~initramfs@ ) ("Leaving")
[11:28:50] <zero-ghost> beside you know theres that movie torrent site in zeronet
[11:28:54] <zero-ghost> "Play"
[11:29:20] <zero-ghost> zeronet relies on individual people choosing to mirror the website though
[11:29:30] <zero-ghost> maidsafe is autonomous and self-replicating
[11:29:38] <zero-ghost> so no one chooses anything it will just keep living on
[11:30:00] <zero-ghost> and one of the i2p devs is helping get zeronet running inside i2p
[11:30:41] <zero-ghost> since right now the torrent tracker sites in i2p are just centrlized servers somewhere

[13:31:40] <Chiitoo> Not sure “handed over” is the way to put it.  :]
[13:31:43] <Chiitoo> Not that I know really.
[13:32:07] <cisc> well it redirects
[13:32:40] <Chiitoo> They decided to move it to under “qtox” from “tux3”, from what I've seen.
[13:32:44] <cisc> just wondering if tux3 ended up transferring ownership or not
[13:35:32] <Chiitoo> No idea who is the actual owner of that repository.  I'd still imagine tux3 being the boss, but I could be wrong.  :D
[13:36:02] <cisc> wrong
[13:36:53] <cisc> qtox-issue-import was an interim repo as the issues were transferred over
[13:37:24] <cisc> but as that process started, a python script was used to transfer open/closed issues
[13:37:39] <cisc> tux3 may have handed over the repo, that's what i'm asking
[13:38:28] <Chiitoo> Yes I was here when that was going on, and from that I'm saying it doesn't seem like “he handed over the repo”.
[13:41:01] <zetok> yes, tux3 moved the repo
[13:41:43] * zetok wouldn't call it "handing over" either
[13:42:51] <cisc> i thought so
[13:43:00] <cisc> yes not quite, but at least he did
[13:43:15] <zetok> >No idea who is the actual owner of that repository.
[13:43:45] <zetok> people with admin access are antis81, sudden6, tux3 and me
[13:44:37] <zetok> as for write access, everyone in @qTox/core team
[13:45:55] <cisc> "begrudgingly handing it over"
[13:46:58] <zetok> um, those aren't the words that I'd use
[13:47:21] <cisc> what would you use?
[13:47:46] <zetok> tux3 just needed a friendly nudge to do it :)
[13:48:55] <zetok> anyway; regarding repo management
[13:49:57] <zetok> I kinda wonder whether a new group should be added
[13:53:23] <zetok> or something.
[13:55:16] <Chiitoo> I'd be good for a 'never gets anything done' group!

[15:15:01] <initramfs> Does anyone know the reason that qTox is being compiled without exception support (-fno-exceptions)? I'd post an issue but I figured it'd be faster just to ask here...

[16:20:24] <zetok> probably because they shouldn't be used
[16:20:41] *** Joins: hpanago (uid15586@ )
[16:31:44] <initramfs> Any reason for that? I was thinking about including their use...
[16:38:58] <zetok> aren't exceptions a bad idea?
[16:47:17] <initramfs> Why? C++11 support very elegant exception types
[16:47:38] <zetok> dunno about that
[16:48:28] <initramfs> Well, a lot of times, functions within qTox return null or invalid quantities to distinguish between positive results and failure states
[16:49:17] <initramfs> Such mechanisms fall short when there are multiple ways something can fail. Exceptions come in handy there, to distinguish between the ways things fail.
[16:49:41] <initramfs> Exceptions in C/C++ were messy before C++11, but since then it's been pretty decent.
