[06:21:13] <nurupo> tux3: i will keep 5.5.1 around, so if there is any issue, you can switch back to it
[06:24:30] <nurupo> also, anyone is up for a fun project? https://wiki.tox.chat/users/nodes#is_there_anything_else_bootstrap_node_related_i_can_help_with_besides_running_a_bootstrap_node

[10:35:57] <zetok> hello Allanitomwesh :)
[10:37:42] <Allanitomwesh> been using this client
[10:37:51] <Allanitomwesh> my freind had a weird bug
[10:38:14] <Allanitomwesh> when i voice called him he could only get audio while looking at the settings page
[10:38:25] <Allanitomwesh> in the actual chat he was muted
[10:39:20] <Diadlo> Allanitomwesh: https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3538 the same?
[10:41:32] <Allanitomwesh> yeah simiar
[10:41:48] <Allanitomwesh> but not windows and not 1.4 client
[10:43:37] <tux3> nurupo, thanks! I'll try to switch the windows builds
[10:48:00] <Diadlo> zetok: 
[10:48:01] <Diadlo> 1) Review PR using Reviewable
[10:48:03] <Diadlo> 2) Test PR using `test-pr.sh $PR`
[10:48:04] <Diadlo> 3) If alright mark as `LGTM`
[10:48:06] <Diadlo> 4) Wait few another `LGTM`
[10:48:07] <Diadlo> 5) Merge using ./merge-pr.sh $PR
[10:48:09] <Diadlo> 6) Check signature
[10:48:10] <Diadlo> 7) git push

[11:11:46] <zetok> Diadlo: ~yep :)
[11:11:59] <Diadlo> zetok:  Why `~` ?)
[11:12:25] <zetok> Diadlo: waiting for lots of LGTMs is usually not necessary
[11:15:29] <Diadlo> zetok:  Why? I can not see some errors. I think we should wait at least 2 LGTM. You disagree?
[11:16:24] <Diadlo> s/I can not see/Any maintainer can not see/
[11:16:33] <zetok> valid point
[11:16:49] <initramfs> Diadlo: Well, I say the number of "lgtm"s would be based on the size of the PR. I mean a one line change probably doesn't warrant 4 lgtms...
[11:17:02] <zetok> that's a problem that should be fixed, rather than working around it by multiple people reviewing stuff
[11:17:06] <Diadlo> initramfs: Yep

[19:49:55] <nurupo> tux3: btw, guess what debian package got updated https://gist.github.com/nurupo/da2f1200fbe76a20061b6eae902bfa28
[19:50:32] <tux3> \o/
[19:50:43] <tux3> That's awesome
[19:51:05] <nurupo> someone has also replied to https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher/issues/176
[19:52:15] <tux3> Ok, so that explains why the hell it had a dependency on GDI32
[19:52:50] <tux3> nurupo, could you try upgrading NSIS on the build machine? I don't think anything will break, hopefully
[19:53:43] <nurupo> sure, i can try in 2 or so hours
[19:54:01] <nurupo> as long as pulling the package from experimental doesn't break debian
[19:54:25] <nurupo> looks like it depends on the same glibc version as stable, so at least that's fine
[19:54:28] <tux3> So far my sid/testing/experimental Frankendebian mix is holding up pretty well :)
[19:55:23] <nurupo> hopefully the plugin .dll we wget works with nsis 3
[19:55:31] <tux3> Fingers crossed
[19:56:12] <tux3> Otherwise I'll have to fix the awful Visual Studio 6.0 code..
