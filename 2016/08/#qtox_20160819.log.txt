[18:18:13] <ovalseven8> tux3, zetok: Is qTox already using NSIS 3 ?
[18:18:23] <zetok> dunno
[18:18:43] <zetok> IIRC tux3 asked nurupo to update it on the server
[18:29:24] <tux3> ovalseven8, yes!
[18:29:40] <tux3> Tho the stable builds are still using NSIS2, since they were built before the update
[18:29:49] <tux3> So, next release
[18:30:00] <tux3> (or use the nightlies)
[18:30:13] <ovalseven8> Isn't it possible to rebuild?
[18:31:40] <tux3> We could, but since it's not very well tested yet, that could create bugs in the stable release
