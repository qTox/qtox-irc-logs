[00:01:10] <nurupo> be careful with using Qt macros and things, as some of them are marked as deprecated in favor of c++ stl alternatives
[00:02:12] <nurupo> off top of my head, i think it's not recommended to use qt algorithms
[00:03:05] <nurupo> hm, looks like nothing from QtGlobal is deprecated
[00:03:20] *** Joins: abbat (~abbat@ )
[00:03:25] <tux3> In practice Qt would never be able to remove them without breaking a lot of stuff I imagine
[00:04:07] <tux3> But it seems to be that a lot of the Qt shims aren't really justified anymore with the state of modern C++
[00:04:14] <nurupo> at least not until the next major release
[00:04:38] <tux3> Perhaps, yes. One can dream :)
[00:04:41] <nurupo> it's just that Qt included functionality that c++ stl didn't have at the time
[00:04:51] <tux3> Yeah, Qt is surprisingly old
[00:05:01] <tux3> There wasn't anything standard at the time
[00:05:21] <nurupo> also the reason why it has its own containers, doesn't use exceptions, etc
[00:06:15] <nurupo> Qt things have quite nice syntactic sugar though
[00:07:31] <nurupo> java-style iterators are pretty, inline things like "QList() << elem1 << elem2" are also pretty. the latter can be replaced with the initialiser list in modern c++ though
[00:09:17] <tux3> I love Qt, it's ridiculously high-level. The ISO comitee won't even agree to add std::string::split because they can't think of a way to make it fast for every case..
[00:09:36] <tux3> The STL is "the intersection of your needs, not the union", they say
[00:11:39] <tux3> I'd rather have convenience by default, C++ still allows to reimplement everything, and even drop down all the way to ASM if I need to fix a performance problem.
[00:18:52] <nurupo> i'd rather have solid foundation by default and convenience as provided by some library
[00:20:47] <tux3> Maybe, but in comparison to other languages, the STL is a bit underwhelming. Splitting strings is rarely performance critical, and very often used. I'm a bit sour about std::string::split =]
[00:23:01] <nurupo> i also kind of don't like that fs, networking and things are being added to c++ standard library. the standard library was always minimalistic and there are libraries that do a very good job at these things, but suddenly we port these libraries (i'm looking at Boost) into the standard library
[00:23:50] <nurupo> well, there are also pros of this, and perhaps there are more pros than cons, but i thought that standard library's idiology was to be simple, but apparently it's not
[00:24:08] <nurupo> s/simple/minimalistic/
[00:24:17] <tux3> I think the philosophy is really to be the intersection of everyone's needs
[00:24:33] <tux3> In 2016, not having threads, networking, or even filesystem support was really pathetic
[00:24:38] <tux3> That made it hard to write portable programs
[00:25:07] <tux3> Everyone relying on Boost as a defacto standard because the STL is stuck 20 years in the past is hardly a great solution
[00:26:30] <tux3> Now if you're talking about adding things like GUI and grahics into the STL, I get a little queasy, but I think some evolution is good :)
[00:27:21] <nurupo> Qt in the standard library when? :)
[00:27:34] <nurupo> c++ will have standard library comparable to java's runtime library
[00:27:36] <nurupo> :D
[00:27:37] <tux3> Heh. On Bjarne's dead body!
[00:27:45] <tux3> Boost is pretty much STL-next though
[00:29:03] <nurupo> i think there were even proposals for adding 2d graphics to the standard library, i think it was even based off sdl
[00:29:13] <tux3> Yeah, based on cairo
[00:29:22] <tux3> It's really not even close to Java or C# though, there was a chart made I think
[00:29:29] <tux3> Yeah, http://pocoproject.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CppPortableLib.jpg
[00:29:42] <nurupo> [meme image] let's add all the libraries to the standard library!
[00:30:09] <tux3> The Java and C# libraries are literally dozens of time bigger than all of C++11's STL
[00:30:12] <nurupo> suddenly 500mb libstdc++-999.dll
[00:30:19] <tux3> lol
[00:30:37] <tux3> And then embeded platforms will still implement only 1% of it :)
[00:30:40] <nurupo> can we ups it? no, it would break Qt inside of it
[00:30:43] <nurupo> *upx
[00:31:18] <tux3> Whatever, real programmers run without the standard library anyways!
[00:31:23] <tux3> Ring0 is where it's at!

[20:42:43] <zetok> (if someone wants, please say so)
[20:42:52] * tux3 closes the tab
[20:43:21] <zetok> don't worry, I've got an actual PR, not just a translation update ;)
[20:43:42] <tux3> Well I couldn't have helped you with that translation anyways :)

[20:45:20] <qTox-Website> [qTox-Website] zetok opened pull request #11: add doxygen docs to links in the "footer" (master...doxy) https://git.io/v6wCY
[20:45:22] <zetok> ↑ :)
[20:46:04] <zetok> re: review; I was wondering whether to enable reviewable on the website repo
[20:46:27] <zetok> with the same settings that other repos have
[20:46:43] <zetok> (i.e. to require explicit LGTM)
[20:47:15] <tux3> zetok, hm, does it make sense to add a translation string for a noun that probably shouldn't be translated?
[20:47:34] <tux3> I don't know about reviewables. I like simplicity, but I know you like rules.
[20:47:44] <zetok> well
[20:48:26] <zetok> simple is nice in its own way
[20:49:25] <zetok> dunno about the noun, I thought that someone might want to translate it, so I left it as translatable
[20:50:15] <tux3> I don't think product nouns are translatable, unless the company has a special name for the product in a target country 
[20:50:28] <zetok> hm.
[20:50:50] <tux3> I wouldn't add the complexity before we actually need it :)
[20:51:07] <tux3> If we neeed to translate it somehow, we can add it back later. Probably, we won't need it.
[20:51:38] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox/qTox-Website/blob/master/index.ar.json ← this
[20:51:50] <zetok> *everything* is translated there
[20:52:03] <zetok> and what matters here, transcribed
[20:52:29] <tux3> Not nouns, typically
[20:52:30] <tux3>  "Source on GitHub": "GitHub المصدر على",
[20:52:41] <tux3> Same in Japanese, Chinese, etc from what I've seen
[20:53:08] <zetok> typically
[20:53:28] <zetok> it doesn't hurt to leave it translatable, costs nothing, and if someone wants to translate they can
[20:54:04] <tux3> Adding things we don't need is not good, it piles up and becomes technical debt over time
[20:54:18] <zetok> and adding/removing translatable string to .json files is just a simple sed command, so this too is not a problem
[20:54:22] <tux3> The goal is to remove as many lines as possible, until nothing else can be removed
[20:54:23] <zetok> err
[20:54:30] <zetok> nope
[20:54:44] <zetok> content needs to be translatable
[20:54:49] <tux3> Yes
[20:54:59] <tux3> Not nouns like Doxygen or Github though
[20:56:14] <iphy> Githöb
[20:57:40] <tux3> google.com/?q=Githöb -> 2 results :)

[21:04:38] *** Quits: athan (~athan@ ) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[21:12:44] <zetok> so, it's good for merge?
[21:12:52] <tux3> No?
[21:13:06] <zetok> :f
[21:13:20] <tux3> 98% of that PR is fluff :/
[21:14:18] <tux3> Sorry that I'm asking you to delete a lot of stuff you changed, but it could really be simpler
[21:14:37] <zetok> except that it can't, AFAIK
[21:15:17] <zetok> your only argument is that it might not be needed
[21:15:36] <tux3> My argument is that it might be needed, but it's very unlikely :)
[21:15:50] <zetok> not likely ≠ impossible
[21:15:59] <tux3> Yes!
[21:16:11] <zetok> so, there's no problem and it can be merged :)
[21:16:20] <tux3> No!
[21:16:30] <zetok> but it's needed.
[21:16:45] <tux3> Not right no, now, since the translations are all empty
[21:16:52] <zetok> …
[21:16:58] <tux3> There's a teeny tiny chance that we might need it one day, if that
[21:16:58] <zetok> that's bullshit
[21:17:09] <tux3> It's not bullshit just because we disagree
[21:17:24] <tux3> You literally added 48 empty transalations, what the fuck is the point of that?
[21:17:25] <zetok> translations *are* supposed to be empty until someone will translate
[21:17:37] <tux3> There is nothing to translate here, it's a noun
[21:17:46] <zetok> I'd suggest you to go and read weblate docs
[21:18:09] <tux3> That's an easy thing to say when you don't want to argue, ask people to do research...
[21:18:57] <zetok> it just seems that at least part of your argument is based on lack of knowledge what weblate requires "source" json to have
[21:20:00] <zetok> >There is nothing to translate here, it's a noun
[21:20:28] *** Joins: athan (~athan@ )
[21:20:31] <zetok> and this is something that I'd consider to be a bullshit, unless you *know* every language out there, including the artificial ones
[21:20:59] <tux3> Hmm, I'm pretty sure that's a general rule
[21:21:34] <zetok> not really
[21:21:39] <tux3> The problem is that if you try to account for every thing that we could possibly need, even if we'll never need it, it makes things harder to maintain
[21:22:24] <zetok> it's a custom that most of languages follow, but AFAIK generally there's no hard rule to not transcribe stuff
[21:22:36] <zetok> >The problem is that if you try to account for every thing that we could possibly need, even if we'll never need it, it makes things harder to maintain
[21:22:50] <zetok> and that's another argument that I'd consider to be a bullshit, given the scope of the PR
[21:23:16] <tux3> The PR could be a one liner, and instead if modifies 49 files, I think that's needless complexity
[21:23:33] <zetok> sed -i '/"Developer Links":/a\    "Doxygen": "",' index.*.json
[21:23:38] <zetok> ↑ this is *not* complex
[21:24:41] <tux3> It makes the files longer and longer for something we don't need, and it's harder to review because 2% of meaningful changes is hidden in 98% of fluff.
[21:24:58] <tux3> Yes, it's easy to add a lot of things we don't need with sed :/
[21:25:32] <zetok> >It makes the files longer and longer for something we don't need
[21:25:34] <zetok> bullshit
[21:25:36] <tux3> Can you think of a single language where there would be a translation for Doxygen?
[21:25:44] <tux3> Even one, even one we don't have?
[21:25:50] <zetok> you haven't proven that it's not needed
[21:26:06] <tux3> You have to prove that things you add in PRs are needed
[21:26:21] <tux3> You're trying to make a change here!
[21:26:26] <zetok> yes
[21:26:30] <zetok> and change will happen
[21:26:40] <zetok> Either way.
[21:26:43] <tux3> That's not a very helpful mindset.
[21:27:00] <zetok> oh, it's very helpful :)
[21:27:19] <zetok> I have a point where I am, and I know the point where I want to be.
[21:27:37] <tux3> Yes, and it looks almost like you only want reviews to be rubber stamping..
[21:27:42] <tux3> I'd like to be wrong
[21:27:43] <zetok> that quite simplifies things, and makes it clear what needs to be done
[21:28:05] <tux3> I'm sure.
[21:28:09] <zetok> I'd like reviews to catch actual mistakes & stuff that is simply wrong
[21:28:40] <tux3> I think you're making things more complicated that they need to be
[21:28:54] <tux3> But we'll probably waste more time talking about this PR than doing anything els
[21:28:59] <tux3> So go ahead if you will
[21:28:59] <zetok> except that there's not much of complication here
[21:29:08] <tux3> No, there is not much complication.
[21:29:24] <tux3> But I don't think you can reasonnably argue that it's needed, even if it's a small complication
[21:29:56] <tux3> Maybe we're bikeshedding though, so go ahead if you want, but if you do that with every review I don't think it'll be a good thing
[21:30:04] <zetok> well, my argument is that it's probably needed, and if not even right now, at some point it will be needed
[21:30:21] <zetok> right
[21:30:25] <tux3> If it were probably needed, perhaps you would be able to show even a single case were it would have a use
[21:30:31] <tux3> Even for a language we don't actually use
[21:30:55] <zetok> "better safe than sorry"
[21:31:53] <tux3> I don't see how we would be sorry to not add things until we need them
[21:32:05] <tux3> You showed that it was only one sed command to add this, after all.
[21:32:42] <tux3> But I think we're wasting more time arguing in circle that we could spend doing more productive things :)
[21:32:57] <zetok> >tux3> I don't see how we would be sorry to not add things until we need them
[21:33:08] <zetok> probably because you're not looking from the right perspective
[21:33:14] <tux3> Maybe
[21:33:34] <zetok> i.e. the perspective shouldn't be of a programmer, but only a translator who uses simple web UI to translate stuff
[21:33:52] <zetok> and they don't have a way to translate stuff that it not explicitly made translatable
[21:34:00] <tux3> The translator would have an easier job if they weren't given untranslatable nouns...
[21:34:12] <zetok> and when one wants to translate something that doesn't have a way to be translated, that makes one sad
[21:34:28] <zetok> nah, "untranslatable" stuff is the easiest to "translate"
[21:34:40] <zetok> you just press the button to copy original as translation & you're done
[21:34:42] <tux3> It is a waste of time, though.
[21:35:08] <zetok> yes, translating generally is a waste of time
[21:35:16] <tux3> I don't think so :/
[21:35:24] <zetok> but it is.
[21:35:36] <zetok> so much time would have been saved if everyone used the same languages.
[21:35:38] <zetok> language.
[21:35:46] <zetok> no need to translate at all
[21:36:04] <tux3> If you want to do philosophy, you could argue that life is meaningless and however you decide to use your time is a waste, unless you're having fun :)
[21:36:21] <zetok> err
[21:36:39] <zetok> what you've said is true though
[21:36:46] <Chiitoo> tux3: Did you steal that from me!?  If not, we think quite alike, hahaha.  (I say the same thing now and then.)
