[18:56:51] <qTox-syncbot> Amit Agnani: Should the clang-format style be all emcompassing? i.e. should it contain best-practices that aren't yet in our coding guidelines?
[18:58:15] <qTox-syncbot> Zetok
[18:59:43] <qTox-syncbot> Amit Agnani: Well, it's not under the currently published coding guideline
[19:00:17] <qTox-syncbot> Zetok
[19:00:35] <qTox-syncbot> Amit Agnani: My suggestion to the above would be to discuss and tighten up the coding standards, and then have a whole markdown file on the coding standards
[19:00:37] <qTox-syncbot> Zetok
[19:00:41] <qTox-syncbot> Amit Agnani: i.e. extract it out of contributing
[19:01:33] <qTox-syncbot> Amit Agnani: I've been reading up on clang format for the last 30 minutes or so, and I can't seem to write anything more than 5 lines that won't overstretch the existing guidelines
[19:05:25] <qTox-syncbot> Zetok
[19:06:33] <qTox-syncbot> Amit Agnani: Okay, but should that be in the clang-format config. Because in most cases we excuse long lines if they can't be broken (e.g. URLs). It's hard to tell clang-format to ignore such lines...
[19:06:53] <qTox-syncbot> Amit Agnani: If not, it can just exist in the documentation without being actually enforced by clang-format
[19:07:19] <qTox-syncbot> Zetok
[19:07:45] <qTox-syncbot> Zetok
[19:09:11] <qTox-syncbot> Amit Agnani: I'll read more on it
[19:10:21] <qTox-syncbot> Zetok
[19:12:33] <qTox-syncbot> Amit Agnani: Yeah I know
[19:13:05] <qTox-syncbot> Amit Agnani: I get that the idea is to eventually have travis enforce it, once most/all the code is compliant?

[22:55:06] <nurupo> ><Yst> Apparently, qTox dropped support for Tox DNS aside from DNS records under a specific few domain names? What's up with that? A friend wasn't able to add me to their client because qTox was refusing to look up the DNS record.
[22:55:06] <nurupo> ><Yst> Isn't the whole point of DNS that it's distributed and not controlled by a single entity? THis seems like a *major* antifeature in qTox.
[22:55:20] <nurupo> someone fired shots in #tox :P
[22:56:35] <zetok> too bad(?) that they've missed
[22:57:50] *** Quits: abbat (~Anton@ ) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:16:17] <nurupo> hm, right, it shouldn't be "specific few domain names", i think qTox would work with a toxme service on any domain
