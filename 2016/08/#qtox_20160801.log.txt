[13:23:57] <zaggynl> So I have qtox open, have not used it for any chatting/filesending, yet it has used 2GB today?
[13:26:53] <zaggynl> technically that's not a question, 
[13:27:05] <zaggynl> Is it normal for qtox to use that much bandwidth while idling?
[13:55:34] <zetok> ~yep
[13:56:16] <zetok> currently it's ~normal, hopefully it could be optimized in the future
[14:13:41] <zetok> there's an ongoing work on toxcore to make it fully testable, after which improving things could start

[16:20:36] <iphy> hi
[16:21:35] <iphy> who is developing qtox here?
[16:21:48] <iphy> zetok: can you get me in touch with some developers?
[16:44:28] <bashrc> I just submitted a patch. I don't know if that makes me a developer
[16:44:47] <cisc> iphy: https://github.com/tux3/qTox/commits/master
[16:45:40] <iphy> cisc: this tells me who contributed to it
[16:45:45] <iphy> not who is responsible for it
[16:45:57] <iphy> I want to discuss large scale changes to the codebase
[16:46:02] <cisc> iphy: well technically tux3
[16:46:31] <iphy> I took a 10 minute look at the code and I'm fairly horrified (not as much as when I looked at utox, but still)
[16:46:57] <iphy> so I think before we can continue developing features, we need to do some major refactoring
[16:47:50] <iphy> if the qtox developers are against that, I'll drop qtox work for now (I need to focus on toxcore tests) and come back to it in half a year or so
[16:49:44] <iphy> I think rewriting it from scratch will take more time and be a lot less rewarding in the next year of time than refactoring, so I hope that's the direction we can take
[16:50:29] *** Joins: dongo (~dongo@ )
[16:53:55] <cisc> maybe it's time to fork qtox then
[16:54:07] <iphy> I would like to avoid that
[16:54:31] <iphy> and I won't do it before toxcore is done
[16:54:33] <cisc> i think zetok was already talking about that since tux3 doesn't appear very interested in contributing to it
[16:55:52] <cisc> iphy: if you know what needs to be done then maybe you can talk with antis81 & Diadlo and give them an outline of where they should be focusing their contributions & what you think needs to be changed
[16:56:33] <iphy> cisc: I know what needs to be done, but I'd like to discuss some specifics with people who have been working with the code
[16:56:38] <cisc> and sudden6
[16:56:56] <iphy> ok, only Diadlo is here
[16:57:02] <iphy> I'll wait for the others
[17:00:35] <cisc> iphy: what kind of problems are you seeing in the code, roughly?
[17:00:38] <cisc> just craziness?
[17:01:46] <iphy> cisc: so far I've only looked at the #include directives :)
[17:01:58] <iphy> trying to get some idea of the dependency graph
[17:02:07] <iphy> and then I stopped
[17:02:08] <cisc> well obviously priority #1 right now is toxcore, so I agree with you
[17:12:45] <Diadlo> iphy: Hello. I never seen antis81 here
[17:13:52] <iphy> how do you discuss things?
[17:14:14] <iphy> I'll open an issue on qtox/qtox tonight to discuss

[17:40:05] <zetok> aside from people with write access to tux3/qTox most active contributors are only partly here â€“ Diadlo, anoa
[17:40:21] <zetok> BiTOk_
[17:40:47] <zetok> aside from them, there's also @initramfs on github, who is ~now refactoring video stuff
[17:41:37] <zetok> ><iphy> how do you discuss things?
[17:41:38] <iphy> ok
[17:41:51] <zetok> for the best visibility, tux3/qTox would do for now
[17:41:55] <iphy> I'll let you guys refactor stuff for a while then
[17:41:55] <iphy> let me know when it's done
