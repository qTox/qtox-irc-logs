[09:00:21] <Diadlo> Hello
[09:01:12] <Diadlo> What you think: I have the same problem with https://github.com/tux3/qTox/issues/3538, but on new versions. Should I create new issue?

[09:30:28] <zetok> um, that's not a real problem if the issue is reproducible at all
[09:30:53] <zetok> if reproducible on master → needs to be fixed
[09:31:08] <zetok> if not → user is asked to re-test

[09:49:26] *** Joins: abbat (~abbat@ )
[10:03:31] <zetok> fug.
[10:04:25] <zetok> looks like everything on the internets that could be used to import issues is either broken, or requires admin access
[10:06:46] <Diadlo> "perfect"
[10:14:46] <Diadlo> zetok: For import ot export?
[10:15:05] <zetok> importing from tux3/qTox
[10:15:20] <zetok> it's not possible to export issues on gh
[10:17:20] <nurupo> lies, you can use gh api to export issues to your local machine :P
[10:17:36] <nurupo> that's what the github backup haskell program does
[10:18:13] <nurupo> you can't import them as they are into another repo though
[10:18:44] <nurupo> moving qtox repo from tux3/ to qtox/ should preserve all the issues though, i think
[10:21:44] <zetok> lol
[10:22:16] <zetok> nurupo: https://github.com/tux3/qTox/issues/3578
[10:23:02] <zetok> since there is ~consensus that move should happen, I'm looking into what can be done when tux3 doesn't want to cooperate
[10:23:57] <zetok> https://github.com/qTox-issue-import/qTox/issues ← test repo, currently it looks bad
[10:24:38] <Diadlo> Yep
[10:26:51] <nurupo> yeah, that the only way to import them
[10:26:55] <nurupo> *that's
[10:27:22] <zetok> via broken python scripts*

[10:31:53] <nurupo> you might have caused a lot of email spam with this importing :)
[10:32:29] <zetok> ?
[10:32:34] <nurupo> hm, doesn't look like i have received any emails
[10:32:49] <zetok> um, there's no activity

[10:33:19] <zetok> yes, this is not activity

[10:33:56] <nurupo> my definition of activity includes "interlinking stuff"
[10:34:13] <nurupo> doesn't seem like gh notifies people of that, which is good

[15:29:51] <cisc> zetok: on your issue: https://github.com/tux3/qTox/issues/3578 you didn't add a heading nor explain, one such as "What happens if tux3 agrees"
[15:30:03] <cisc> then bullets under that. that's my suggestion
[15:30:29] <zetok> I did though?
[15:30:49] <cisc> where?
[15:30:57] <zetok> >If cooperation were to happen, all of that would be ~preserved.
[15:31:46] <cisc> so why is What moving away means without @tux3 cooperating? a bold heading, not If cooperation were to happen also
[15:31:57] <cisc> shouldn't they both be
[15:32:01] <cisc> since they are core issues
[15:32:15] <zetok> thing is, he already repeatedly refused
[15:32:48] <cisc> k...
[15:33:01] <cisc> and also "
[15:33:02] <cisc> This isn't quire right, since whatever can be pushed to master with no..."
[15:33:06] <cisc> "quire" :)
[15:35:29] <zetok> thanks
[15:35:59] <cisc> sure
[15:38:54] <zetok> ><zetok> thing is, he already repeatedly refused
[15:39:12] <zetok> btw, if anyone is interested in convincing tux3, please do so
[15:39:40] <zetok> I have kinda given up on it, but perhaps someone will be more successful
[15:40:38] <cisc> zetok: enough time has already passed
[15:40:52] <zetok> oh, I don't mean to ~wait
[15:41:35] <cisc> even if we convinved him what what the benefit be?
[15:41:40] <zetok> I'm merely saying that convincing tux3 might still be possible, so if someone feels confident that they could do it, they should try
[15:41:48] <cisc>  /s/convinved/convinced
[15:42:21] <cisc> meaning comparing to him transfering the repo
[15:42:30] <zetok> um?
[15:42:31] <cisc> I know there are drawbacks if he doesn't want to cooperate
[15:42:47] <zetok> there are ~no drawbacks
[15:43:17] <cisc> but if he doesn't want to relinquish the repo, then you lose all issues?
[15:43:34] <zetok> I'm working on that
[15:44:08] <cisc> I don't see any reason for him not handing over the repo as he signed out right in the middle of your chat and said himself he's not interested in doing much with qTox these days
[15:44:13] <cisc> aside from bragging rights
[15:44:22] <zetok> by the end of the day I might learn enough of python to ~fix issue importing script enough to get stuff migrated
[15:46:14] <cisc> good. then if not, we could recreate the important issues, and a lot of those past ones are most likely old and no longer are relevant
[15:46:35] <zetok> um
[15:46:54] <zetok> manually "copying" each issue is already possible
[15:47:09] <cisc> ok
[15:47:19] <zetok> what I'm looking into, is copying all the stuff under an hour by an automated script
[15:48:26] <zetok> possibly could be done way faster, but it's better to stay on the "safe" side of gh's rate-limiting
[15:49:16] <zetok> actually.
[15:54:22] <cisc> zetok: are the jenkins builds going to switch over to the new repo, meaning someone like nurupo is going to make the modification?
[15:54:35] <zetok> hopefully at some point

[21:36:36] <zetok> apparently there exists a cheap workaround for the crap I'm getting, which is "try again until done'
[21:36:41] <zetok> :/
[21:36:53] <sudden6> what's so special about issue #12

[21:40:52] <sudden6> also migrating doesn't have to work yet

[21:42:41] <sudden6> well, show me the script anyway
[21:43:57] <zetok> https://github.com/IQAndreas/github-issues-import
[21:45:10] <zetok> ok, I'm just going to try with "try again", aka https://github.com/IQAndreas/github-issues-import/pull/32
[21:45:28] <zetok> btw, fuck gh
[21:49:45] <sudden6> maybe try with only open issues?
[21:50:21] <zetok> um
[21:50:37] <zetok> not much would be preserved this way
[21:51:08] <sudden6> I know, but it would help to test if script is faulty or you run into gh api rate limit :)
[22:03:47] <zetok> it is probably rate limiting
[22:03:55] <zetok> they don't have docs on that though
[22:04:35] <zetok> i.e. they have docs on rate-limiting when querying for info, and only mention that creating stuff is more limited
[22:06:44] <zetok> https://gist.github.com/zetok/99ebe97d3503f0b80c604474010f15b4 ← perhaps will work
