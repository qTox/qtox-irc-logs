[16:08:52] <tux3> ovalseven8: Thanks. We can totally kill toxdns now that we have HTTPS support. Wish we had better though.
[16:10:39] <tux3> I don't think we're going to get names throught the DHT or equivalent anytime soon, but maybe there's something to be done with multiple toxme servers and shamir's secret sharing so no single entity can forge your Toxme name.

[20:06:55] <sudden6> oh, I already submitted my comments to reviewable
[20:17:44] <Diadl0> sudden6: Ok :)
[20:21:28] <Diadl0> sudden6: You have something against doxygen-style comments?
[20:22:04] <sudden6> don't all doxygen-style comments show up in doxygen output?
[20:22:35] <Diadl0> Only comments before function, AFAIK
[20:22:43] <Diadl0> And with tags
[20:23:48] <sudden6> ok, then I was wrong, I thought they would also show up in the output
[20:24:09] <Diadl0> sudden6: Wait a sec. I will test it now
[20:24:37] <sudden6> I'd still prefer the normal // and /* style for inline code comments, because it makes it clear it's not going to doxygen
[20:27:40] <Diadl0> sudden6: I was wrong
[20:27:42] <Diadl0> Sorry
[20:27:56] <sudden6> thx for testing :)
[20:31:41] <Diadl0> sudden6: I think, I split the PR on two (how recommended iphyf). Alright?
[20:32:36] <sudden6> idk, there are only minor fixes left and one would have to review everything again
[20:32:41] <sudden6> iphy: ?

[21:02:54] <iphy> qtox is fairly buggy on osx
[21:03:10] <iphy> the chat edit box doesn't support cmd+backspace
[21:03:22] <iphy> and sometimes it misses the first 1-2 characters I type before it starts accepting them
[21:05:08] <iphy> that happens when the blinking cursor goes away
[21:06:22] <iphy> I don't know when it happens - it seems to happen randomly
[21:07:50] <sudden6> iphy: qtox swallowing chars on osx is a long know issue, nobody managed to solve it...
[21:08:08] <sudden6> mainly due to non reproducable and missing hardware
[21:10:15] <cisc> that same thing happened on a friend running OS X, must happen a lot, on a lot of Apple hardware
[21:12:19] <iphy> I can reliably reproduce it now
[21:14:13] <iphy> scroll in the chat log, then the cursor goes away
[21:19:48] <iphy> no need to scroll
[21:19:54] <iphy> just move the mouse cursor over the chat log

[21:29:00] <Diadl0> sudden6: What about tags like <b> in translation?
[21:29:13] <Diadl0> Or better avoid of is?
[21:30:18] <sudden6> Ideally we'd only have text in translations, though I'm not 100% sure this is practical or the best solution
[21:30:47] <sudden6> because if the translator want's to reorder sentences it'll cause problems with the formatting

[22:33:33] <Diadl0> About moving settings groups
[22:33:52] <sudden6> probably the best idea
[22:33:57] <sudden6> old 
[22:34:06] <sudden6> so old fileformat + new ui
[22:34:08] <Diadl0> Okay :(
[22:36:40] <sudden6> maybe we should switch the config file to a more extendable one soon
[22:37:14] <sudden6> then we'll only need the one conversion
[22:37:23] <Diadl0> Maybe remove groups at all?
[22:41:36] <Diadl0> But it will make config file not easy to read
