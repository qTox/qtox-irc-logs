[15:56:29] <iphy> antis81 seems to be doing good work
[15:57:32] <iphy> I don't like huge changes though.. rewriting half the code in one PR seems dangerous
[15:57:44] <iphy> will that PR be broken into digestible pieces later?

[20:18:44] <bashrc> is it possible to open qtox maximized?

[21:21:51] <Chiitoo> Hum.  There's even a 'Wrapper to work around the lack of mkstemp() on mingw.' in 'libavutil/file.h' but it seems I'm still having issues with it.  That seems peculiar, though I'm probably just not seeing something obvious.  :V
