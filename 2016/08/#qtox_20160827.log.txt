[09:12:54] <Bleh> Hi there. I'm curiouis if these major connection errors will be fixed soon or if you are aware of them
[09:13:06] <Bleh> Using a tor proxy has proven awful
[09:13:13] <Bleh> Things frequently connect and disconnect
[09:13:24] <Bleh> And all sorts of other things
[09:29:02] <Bleh> Also this connection error causes a number of other bugs
[09:29:33] <Bleh> For example, when sending text to another user, the thing frequently disconnects then takes at least 20 minutes to reconnect
[10:03:47] <initramfs> Bleh: Are you sure it's not a tor issue? Also, if you can reproduce the issue in a reliable way, consider submitting an issue with your qtox log files
[10:04:05] <Bleh> alright
[10:04:27] *** Bleh is now known as Se7en
[10:05:19] <Se7en> Are the logs Doxxing?
[10:05:27] <Se7en> I know that the logs contain IP addresses

[12:30:18] <Diadlo> Se7en: Logs don't contains your IP address. It contain bootstrap IP addresses
[12:31:15] <Diadlo> Se7en: Also they can be found here https://nodes.tox.chat/
[12:31:50] <Se7en> Bootstrap?
[12:32:06] <Se7en> What do you  mean by that
[12:32:21] <Se7en> What is a bootstrap node
[12:32:33] <Diadlo> It's nodes, which used to find other nodes. You can read tox specification
[12:33:22] <Se7en> I thought it was peer to peer
[12:33:33] <Diadlo> Yes. It's p2p
[12:33:57] <Se7en> But not Client to Client?
[12:35:28] <Diadlo> I'm not an expert on this area
[12:35:33] <Se7en> Alright
[12:35:44] <Se7en> I was under the assumption that it was client to client
[12:35:47] <Se7en> I am unsure wht
[12:35:49] <Se7en> why
[12:36:49] <Diadlo> Better ask on #tox or #toktok
[12:37:09] <Se7en> They banned me from #tox
[12:37:11] <Se7en> Heh
[12:37:47] <Se7en> I massively pasted a link to this troll image reguarding Tox that installgen2 made and I kept saying YOU HAVE BEEN OUTED
[12:37:47] <Diadlo> Se7en: Ok. I can't give you a correct answer
[12:37:51] <Se7en> They didn't find it funny
[12:58:00] <zetok> Se7en: p2p means "client to client"
[13:04:49] <rerumnovarum> Se7en: it is p2p; it is decentralized; but the point is you still need some entrance point to obtain information about the network; these are bootstrap nodes -- you connect to'em at startup, request info 'bout some other nodes and introduce yourself to them; since that moment you (almost surely) can reach any other node in the network w/o relying on any centralized server&c
[13:07:54] <rerumnovarum> you can see list of bootstrap nodes used by 'reference' tox at https://nodes.tox.chat/
