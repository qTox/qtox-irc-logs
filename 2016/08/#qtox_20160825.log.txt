[11:36:05] <Lord_Vlad> Hello ?
[11:37:07] <Lord_Vlad> Until recently qTox worked fine in every way
[11:37:20] *** Quits: ovalseven8 (~ovalseven@ ) (Quit: Leaving)
[11:37:23] <Lord_Vlad> But now the calls are messed up.
[11:37:36] <Lord_Vlad> Is it just me ?
[11:39:03] <Lord_Vlad> Basically, when I call, my camera and my microphone are not active, they only are if I go to the options...
[11:40:28] <Diadlo> Lord_Vlad: This is same problem https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3538 ?
[11:43:08] <Lord_Vlad> Nearly, because it is not just voice, but also image that doesn't go well. I'll read and test to see if any of the solutions given there are appliable, though.
[11:43:18] <Lord_Vlad> Thanks.
[11:43:58] <Diadlo> Lord_Vlad: You are welcome :)

[12:04:41] <koshii> So on Debian, qtox typically uses 20-30% of one CPU all the time; what is going to be done to bring this down substantially?
[12:04:47] <koshii> I assume this is because of all the P2P connections it is shuffling around
[12:05:29] <Diadlo> koshii: What version are you using?
[12:05:45] <koshii> Git commit: f05b7e040a073c7afadaf763dda5beaf130c6dbd
[12:05:50] <koshii> (from qtox --version)
[12:06:03] <Lord_Vlad> Basically, messing with the options back and forth solved the problem... thanks
[12:08:07] <Diadlo> koshii: I belive, that https://github.com/qTox/qTox/pull/3639 will partially fix this problem
[12:09:41] <zetok> koshii: what CPU?
[12:09:48] <koshii> zetok: i386
[12:09:51] <koshii> 32bit Debian
[12:10:30] <zetok> clocked at?
[12:10:47] <koshii> It's one of these 2 core Atom processors, netbook
[12:10:56] <koshii> Not even sure what the speed is, but bought it this year
[12:11:11] <koshii> Low-power, but qtox is the most demanding process on the system by far
[12:11:33] <zetok> grep 'cpu MHz' /proc/cpuinfo
[12:14:19] <koshii> 2x cpu MHz 2290.050
[12:14:32] <zetok> ok
[12:14:42] <zetok> that CPU usage is definitely not normal
[12:15:30] <zetok> with >150 contacts I have 3-5% CPU usage
[12:15:33] <koshii> I'm pulliing from deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/antonbatenev:/tox/Debian_8.0/ /
[12:15:39] <zetok> @ 4GHz
[12:15:42] <koshii> Right
[12:15:44] <koshii> I didn't think it was normal :)
[12:15:53] <zetok> (the more contacts you have the bigger CPU usage)
[12:16:15] <koshii> I have about 20 contacts
[12:16:32] <koshii> I'm going to guess that I am the only person testing this on 32 bit linux though?

[12:22:07] * zetok wonders
[12:22:30] <koshii> zetok: How much identifying data will come with these logs?
[12:22:49] <zetok> those aren't logs
[12:23:27] <koshii> Logs of a kind :)
[12:23:27] <zetok> it's a graph of functions being called
[12:23:32] <koshii> Ah, I see
[12:24:14] * zetok wonders
[12:24:28] <zetok> koshii: you would want to install debug symbols for stuff
[12:25:06] <koshii> zetok: A different package?
[12:25:25] <koshii> qtox-dbg - Debug symbols for qTox
[12:25:28] <koshii> Right?
[12:25:34] <zetok> at least for qTox, glibc, Qt and ffmpeg
[12:25:54] <koshii> Sounds fun
